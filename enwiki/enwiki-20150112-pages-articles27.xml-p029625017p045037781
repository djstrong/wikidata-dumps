{{Expand German|Die Weber|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Die Weber 1897 by Emil Orlik.jpeg|thumb|320px|An 1897 poster for a performance of the play.]]
'''''The Weavers''''' ({{lang-de|Die Weber}}, [[Silesian German]]: {{lang|sli|''De Waber''}}) is a play written by the German playwright [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] in 1892. The play sympathetically portrays a group of [[Silesia]]n [[weavers]] who staged an [[History of Silesia#Uprising of the Silesian weavers|uprising during the 1840s]] due to their concerns about the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The play was translated to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] by [[Pinchas Goldhar]] in the 1920s, after which it became a favorite of the Yiddish stage. In 1927 it was adapted into a German silent film ''[[The Weavers (1927 film)|The Weavers]]'' directed by [[Frederic Zelnik]] and starring [[Paul Wegener]]. A Broadway version of ''The Weavers'' was staged in 1915–1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=8241 ''The Weavers''] at the [[Internet Broadway Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period, as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions, the play has no true central character, providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting.

==Criticism==
Barrett H. Clark's comments: &quot;as one of Gerhart Hauptmann's experiments in dramatic form, ''The Weavers'' is highly significant. Instead of a hero, he has created a mob; this mob is therefore the protagonist—or chief character—and if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long. It is the weavers as a class that are ever before us, and the unity of the play is in them and in them alone; they are only parts of a larger picture which will take shape as the story advances, and are not intended to be taken as important individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett H. Clark. ''The Continental Drama of Today'' pp. 89–93 (1914) Henry Holt and Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Citrobacter freundii''''' is a species of facultative. anaerobic. Gram-negative bacilli of the Enterobacteriaceae family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/psds-ftss/citrobacter-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria are long rod-shaped with a typical length of 1-5 μm.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11269372&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|11269372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most ''C. freundii'' cells are surrounded by several flagella used for locomotion, but a few are not motile. It can be found in soil, water, sewage, food, and the intestinal tracts of animals and humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11269372&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|11269372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Citrobacter'' genus was discovered in 1932 by Werkman and Gillen. Cultures of'' C. freundii'' were isolated and identified in the same year from soil extracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11269372&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|11269372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an opportunistic pathogen, ''C. freundii'' is responsible for a number of significant infections. It is known to be the cause of a number of nosocomial infections of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood, and many other normally sterile sites in patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17224563&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|17224563}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''C. freundii'' represents about 29% of all opportunistic infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17224563&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|17224563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, this infectious microbe in humans plays a positive role in the environment. ''C. freundii'' is responsible for reducing nitrate to nitrite in the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8983520&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|8983520}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conversion is an important and crucial stage in the [[nitrogen cycle]]. These bacteria also help in recycling nitrogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8983520&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|8983520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. freundii'' has also been investigated for biodegradation of tannic acid used in tanneries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8983520&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|8983520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For metabolism, ''C. freundii'' has an ability to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon and energy source. Within its cell, a bacterial microcompartment can be found, which is capable of processing propanediol.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21245529&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|21245529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oklahoma Lake''' is located in north east [[Oklahoma City]] in the Canadian river valley and borders the [[North Canadian River]] by Westminster Road. The surface area is around 60 acres with a 1/2 acre island and the shoreline is primarily sand. The lake is fed from ground water and the water is usually calm because of the low elevation. The primary fish species are crappie, bass, and channel catfish. Oklahoma Lake activities include swimming, camping, picnics, fishing, and jet-ski sports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oklake.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporter incident===
Djurgården were involved in an incident at [[Swedbank Stadion]], in a match against [[Malmö FF]], on 30 July 2011. The match was abandoned after eleven minutes, with Malmö FF at that time leading 1–0. The minute before, Djurgårdens IF forward [[Daniel Sjölund]] was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]. Six fireworks were launched, forcing referee Martin Hansson to abandon the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotboll.expressen.se/allsvenskan/1.2513970/nya-laktarskandalen-mff-dif-avbrots |title=Nya läktarskandalen - MFF-Dif avbröts |publisher=''[[Expressen]]'' |author=Sigge Dabrowski |language=Swedish |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/match/?scr=result&amp;fmid=1594867 |title=Matchinformation: Malmö FF - Djurgården |publisher=[[Swedish Football Association]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Canal+, one of the fireworks was close to hitting a photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/malmoff/article13398251.ab |title=Ny läktarskandal – matchen avbruten |publisher=''[[Aftonbladet]]'' |author=Patrik Sjögren |language=Swedish |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were different opinions as to where the fireworks came from: Canal+ believed that the fireworks came from the section above the Djurgården terrace while the police believed that the fireworks came from within the Djurgården section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/djurgarden/article13398422.ab |title=Polisen: Allt kommer från Djurgårdens sida |publisher=''[[Aftonbladet]]'' |author=Patrik Sjögren |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish Discipline Committee [[chairman]] Khennet Thallinger stated that they &quot;want to preserve the due process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/fotbolldirekt-nyhet/?cid=33576&amp;archiveId=68 |title=Disciplinnämnden fattar beslut om två veckor |publisher=[[Swedish Football Association]] |language=Swedish |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September 2011, the Committee decided that the game would be replayed from [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]].

As such, neither Djurgården nor Malmö were fined any sums of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/svensk-fotboll/tavling/namnder-och-kommitteer/disciplinnamnden/arkiv/tavling/disciplinnamnden/2011/beslut-i-svffs-disciplinnamnd-5-september-2011/ |title=Beslut i SvFF:s Disciplinnämnd 5 september 2011 |publisher=[[Swedish Football Association]] |author=Erika Zaar |language=Swedish |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/djurgarden/article13577867.ab |title=Domen: Matchen ska spelas om |publisher=''[[Aftonbladet]]'' |author=Patrik Sjögren |language=Swedish |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFA's Competition Committee decided that the rematch would be played on 15 October 2011.

*'''Delete''' - Interesting stuff, but fails [[WP:BAND]] and [[WP:GNG]].  Also appears to be a copyvio of [http://www.synnack.com/about.php].  I've tagged the article for speedy deletion because of the copyvio.  [[mono Chrome]] and [[cut.rate.box]] appear to be similar articles created by the same [[WP:COI|COI]] editor, and may also need to be nominated.

*'''Delete''' closest thing to notability here is having a member, Sand, being a member of to blue linked (for now, won't last long) bands but that is not good enough for [[wp:music]]. [[User:Duffbeerforme|duffbeerforme]] ([[User talk:Duffbeerforme|talk]]) 10:32, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

'''HNLMS Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden''' (Dutch: ''Zr.Ms. Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'') was an [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] ''ramtorenschip''&lt;ref name=k1877&gt;Koloniaal verslag van 1877, Bijlage C [5.10], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ([[turret ship|turret ram ship]]) built in Great Britain for the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] in the mid-1860s. She was transferred to the [[Dutch East Indies]] in 1876 and participated in the [[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem]] in 1894. The ship was [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed in 1899 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1925.

==Design and description==
[[File:NL Prinz Hendrik.jpg|Right elevation drawing, the shaded areas illustrate her armor scheme|thumb|left]]
HNLMS ''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' was ordered from [[Cammell Laird|Laird &amp; Son Co.]] by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] as an enlarged version of the {{sclass|Scorpion|ironclad|6}} turret ships originally ordered by the [[Confederate States Navy]].&lt;ref name=d9&gt;Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[gun turret]]s was normally rotated by two men via a system of gears; 20 seconds were required for a full 360° rotation if a full crew of 19 men was used. The ship's bow was reinforced to act as a [[Naval ram|ram]] and a hurricane deck connected the [[forecastle]] and [[poop deck]]s. For sea passages the ship's [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] could be increased to {{convert|14|ft|1}} by use of hinged [[wikt:bulwark|bulwarks]] {{convert|5|ft|1}} high.&lt;ref name=d0/&gt;

The ship had an [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|230|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|44|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|18|ft|8|in|m}}. She displaced {{convert|3375|t|LT}}. The iron hull was divided by five watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and the ship had a [[double bottom]] beneath the [[engine room|engine]] and [[Boiler room (ship)|boiler rooms]]. Her crew consisted of 230 officers and men.&lt;ref name=d90&gt;Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' had two [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engines]],&lt;ref name=s0&gt;Silverstone, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; built by Lairds, each driving a single {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|1|adj=on}} propeller.&lt;ref name=d0/&gt; The engines were powered by four square [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=s0/&gt; The engines produced a total of {{convert|2426|ihp|lk=in}} which gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|12.09|kn|lk=in}} during her [[sea trial]]s. She carried {{convert|380|LT|t}} of coal and was [[barque]]-rigged with three masts. Her fore and mainmasts were supported by tripods to reduce interference with the firing arcs of the gun turrets by the ship's [[rigging]]. ''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' had a total sail area of {{convert|1554|sqm|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=d0&gt;Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
The ship mounted a pair of [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0}} [[rifled muzzle loader|rifled muzzle-loading guns]] in each gun turret. Each gun weighed {{convert|12.5|LT|t}}. Two {{convert|120|mm|1|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Krupp]] [[breech-loading gun]]s were fitted in the forecastle and another pair in the poop as [[chase gun]]s. Six {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]] were added shortly after completion.&lt;ref name=d9/&gt; They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|1.1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a range about {{convert|3500|yd|m}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46&quot; (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=22 December 2009|publisher=Navweps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armor===
''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' had a complete waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick. Amidships, for a length of {{convert|120|ft|m|1}}, the armor belt had a height of {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} of which {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} below the [[waterline]]. At the bow and stern the belt was only {{convert|2.5|ft|m|1}} high above the waterline. 4.5-inch transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s were provided to protect the bases of the turrets and the machinery spaces from [[raking fire]]. Each turret was protected by {{convert|5.5|in|0|adj=on}} armor plates, although the total thickness around the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] was {{convert|11|in|0}}. The deck was unarmored.&lt;ref name=d0/&gt;

'''''The Conflagration''''' ({{lang-de|Der rote Hahn}}, 1901) is a German play written by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] (1862–1946). Like [[Henrik Ibsen]], Hauptmann focuses attention on social issues. Unlike ''[[The Weavers (play)|The Weavers]]'' (1892) and ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' (1893), it does not seem to have ever been performed on Broadway;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=5892&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was  adapted as a German film in 1962, directed by [[John Olden]] and starring [[Rudolf Platte]] as Schuhmachermeister Fielitz and [[Inge Meysel]] as Frau Fielitz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385199/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Setting: In the neighbourhood of [[Berlin]], around 1901.

Fielitz, a cobbler, is arguing with his wife, who wants them to stop toiling for nothing. She suggests committing arson, setting fire to their house to obtain insurance money. Von Wehrhahn arrives, Mrs. Fielitz being formerly known as Wolff and his housekeeper. Neighbors arrive as well: Langheinrich, a smith, and Rauchhaupt, a retired constable. They make comments about the iron cross inscribed by Rauchhaupt on the grave of her former husband. Later, Langheinrich receives the visit of Dr Boxer, who has returned after being at sea for several years. Gustav, Rauchhaupt's mentally handicapped son, enters briskly, excited, making sounds from his mouth seeming like a trumpet. He drops a box of matches. There is a fire at the Fielitz house, Langheinrich being called as a voluntary fireman. The business is investigated by Wehrhahn, who concludes, contrary to his father's belief, that Gustav is guilty and must be sent away. Despite Rauchhaupt's suspicions, the Fielitz are never found out. They profit by it, together with their family, including their prosperous son-in-law to their daughter, Schmarowski, an architect. Nevertheless, the stress of the experience seems to have affected Fielitz' brain, Mrs Fielitz feels poorly, and just as Fielitz bursts in the room exclaiming: &quot;Me ... me ... me ... me ... it was me that did it!&quot;, his wife wanders, her arms thrashing about, and dies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christopher Sower''' (27 January 1754 in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown, Pennsylvania]] – 3 July 1799 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]) was a [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] and [[publisher]] in [[Pennsylvania]].

==Biography==
He was the son of [[Christopher Sower (younger)|Christopher Sower the younger]] and the grandson of [[Christopher Sower (elder)|Christopher Sower the elder]]. He developed a strong distaste for those who criticized the German sectarians&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;[[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Schwenkfelders]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] and the [[Dunker]] sect of his father. See {{Cite DAB|title=Sower, Christopher (September 1721 - August 26, 1784)|year=1935|author=George Harvey Genzmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their beliefs.  These critics included [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]] and [[John Henry Miller]].  With his preferences, Sower was naturally of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] sympathies before and during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dab&quot;&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Sower, Christopher (January 27, 1754 - July 3, 1799)|year=1935|author=James O. Knauss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his father's Germantown home and printing and publishing operations in 1774 when they were handed over to him without legal formality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Sower, Christopher (September 1721 - August 26, 1784)|year=1935|author=George Harvey Genzmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began publishing a newspaper, ''Germantowner Zeitung'', which had a loyalist tone so far as the authorities allowed. When the British occupied [[Philadelphia]] in 1777, he moved there.  During this time he was wounded and captured by rebel troops; he was released by exchange a short time later. He accompanied the British to [[New York City]] in 1778 when they abandoned Philadelphia.  That year the family belongings were confiscated and sold by the rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;dab&quot;/&gt;

After [[Siege of Yorktown|Corwallis's defeat]], Sower went to [[England]] from [[New York]] and received an indemnification for his losses.  In 1785 he went to [[New Brunswick]] where he was deputy postmaster and king's printer.  He died in the Baltimore house of his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;dab&quot;/&gt;

&quot;'''Move That Body'''&quot; is a song performed by American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] artist [[Nelly]]. The song features [[T-Pain]] and [[Akon]], and was produced by [[Bangladesh (producer)|Bangladesh]] with [[Dr. Luke]]. The song was released on October 12, 2010, and serves as the second single from Nelly's sixth studio album, ''[[5.0]]''. The song has received negative reviews from various hip-hop critics and fans based upon lack of production and use of auto-tune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poponandon.com/listen-nelly-move-that-body |title=Listen: Nelly – Move That Body « POP On And On |publisher=Poponandon.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/singlesreviews/a301248/nelly-ft-akon-t-pain-move-that-body.html |title=Nelly ft.

The remaining Birse companies continued to function as independent OPCO's under the Balfour Beatty flag.

|Use=Infobox
&lt;!-- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --&gt;
|Source=The cover art can or could be obtained from Continuum Records

|Description= This is the cover art for the extended play album Fire It Up by the artist Kid Rock. The cover art copyright is believed to belong to the label, Continuum Records, or the graphic artist. It was previously deleted from wikipedia because the Fire It Up article was deleted and it turned into an &quot;orphan image.&quot;
|Portion= The entire cover: because the image is cover art, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image.
|Low_resolution= The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original cover. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable as artwork on pirate versions or other uses that would compete with the commercial purpose of the original artwork.
|Purpose= The image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary of the work for which it serves as cover art. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed in the infobox at the top of the article discussing the work, to show the primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Use for this purpose does not compete with the purposes of the original artwork, namely the artist's providing graphic design services to music concerns and in turn marketing music to the public.
|Replaceability= As musical cover art, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the music would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary.
|other_information= Use of the cover art in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alvaro VIII''' (Mvemba a Mpanzu), of the [[House of Kinlaza]], was king of the [[Kingdom of Congo]], from 1666 to 1669.

==Biography==
Alvaro VIII was elevated to the throne by Paulo da Silva, Count of [[Soyo]], which marched on [[M'banza-Kongo|São Salvador]] and killed his predecessor, [[Álvaro VII of Kongo|King Alvaro VII]].

In 1667, he sent his ambassador, Anastasius, to [[Luanda]] ([[Angola]]), to negotiate a treaty that ceded to the Portugueses the right to exploit the mines of Congo, located in the provinces of [[Mbamba]] and [[Mpemba]]. Theodosius, Duke of Mbamba, bowed to the king's decision, but Peter, Duke of Mbemba, refused.

Leading a small army, Peter attacked Mbamba, killed Theodosius and then invaded the kingdom's capital, [[M'banza-Kongo|São Salvador]], killing Alvaro VIII and proclaimed himself king under the name of [[Pedro III of Kongo|Peter III]].

He was brought up in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and educated at [[Eastbourne College]]. For his [[National Service]] he was a [[platoon commander]] in [[Kenya]] during the emergency. After that he was assistant to a professional big game hunter.

He then went up to [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]] to read [[Theology]] with a view to [[ordination]]. However he had difficulties with his faith at that time and joined [[Pfizer]] as a salesman and brand manager. In 1960 he moved to the advertising agency Robert Sharp and Partners running the Players and [[Unilever]] accounts. In 1963 went into the wine business of Charington United Breweries Group (later Bass Charrington). He then moved to [[Jardine Matheson]] where, from 1982 to 1988 he was managing director of wines and spirits.This was one of the most profitable divisions of Jardine Matheson with the majority of its revenues being derived from sales to Japan. Roger Holloway, lived in Japan for some years and was the manager who developed this excellent division for Jardine's.

Meanwhile he had been ordained priest in 1981, as a protégé of [[Robert Runcie]]. He served as a &quot;worker-priest&quot; at St. John's Cathedral in [[Hong Kong]], the Anglican church in [[Tokyo]] and at [[CIA]] and [[NSA]] facilities in Asia. These roles fitted in with his business travel.

In 1988 he settled in London and became a full-time priest at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]] and also appeals director of the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] and Director of the [[Industrial Christian Fellowship]]. In 1997 he was elected Preacher to [[Gray's Inn]], continuing until his death. Also in 1997 he was appointed [[OBE]] &quot;for services to the whisky industry&quot;. With this description, [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] was surprised to see him in clerical dress!

He married in 1962, Anne Alsop, who survives him with three sons and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/religion-obituaries/8135407/The-Reverend-Roger-Holloway.html Obituary], [[The Daily Telegraph]], 16 Nov 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bynum Mound and Village Site''' ([[Smithsonian trinomial|22CS501]]) is a [[Woodland period#Middle Woodland period (1–500 CE)|Middle Woodland period]] [[archaeological site]] located near [[Houston, Mississippi|Houston]] in [[Chickasaw County, Mississippi]]. The complex of six [[burial mounds]] was in use during the Miller 1 and Miller 2 phases of the [[Miller culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/natr/pharr_mounds-bear_creek/sec4-1.htm|title=Pharr Mounds-Ceramic analysis|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ENCYCPREHIST/&gt; and was built between 100 BCE and 100 CE. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as part of the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] at milepost 232.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

==Site description==
The {{convert|6|ha}} site is located on a low ridge which overlooks [[Houlka Creek]] in the [[Tombigbee River]] drainage area.&lt;ref name=ENCYCPREHIST&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Prehistory|volume=6 : North America|edition=1|article=Middle Eastern Woodland|page=331|editor1-first=Peter Neal|editor1-last=Peregrine|editor1-link=Peter N.

In the 1940s, archaeologists with the [[National Park Service]] excavated five of the mounds. The two largest mounds were restored afterward and the site is open to the public and now includes informational plaques. Excavations produced artifacts made from non local materials such as [[Greenstone (archaeology)|Greenstone]], copper, and [[galena]], and distinctive projectile points that did not originate at the site or even in Mississippi. Similar high prestige exotic goods were also found at [[Pharr Mounds]], a nearby contemporaneous site, which show the local peoples involvement with the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell exchange system]], long distance trade network and religious network.&lt;ref name=BYNUM-NPS/&gt;

===Mound A===
During excavations of Mound A archaeologists found the remains of a woman who had been placed between two parallel burned oak logs buried at the base of the mound. They also found ornamental copper spools at each of her wrists. They also found the remains of two adult males and a child.&lt;ref name=BYNUM-NPS/&gt;

===Mound B===
The largest mound at the site, Mound B, was found to be covering a log lined crematory pit. Archaeologists found twenty nine polished greenstone [[Celt (tool)|celts]] arranged in an L-shaped pattern. They also found human remains, some cremated and others unburned, on the ash-covered floor of the pit. Exotic artifacts including copper [[ear-spool]]s, nineteen [[chert]] projectile points believed to have been imported from Hopewell peoples in [[Illinois]], and a piece of galena were also found.&lt;ref name=BYNUM-NPS/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Joint Interagency Task Force West''' ('''JIATFW''', '''JIATF-W''', or '''JIATF West''') is a [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal]] task forces with the responsibility to combat [[illegal drug trade]]-related [[transnational organized crime]] in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The Asia-Pacific area of responsibility for JIATF West includes 36 nations and nearly half of the world's population. JIATF West is one of two Joint Interagency Task Forces with a counter-narcotics mission. The other is [[Joint Interagency Task Force South]]. The task force is run as the &quot;executive agent&quot; of the [[United States Pacific Command]] (USPACOM) and is charged with providing [[U.S. Department of Defense]] &quot;support to law enforcement for counterdrug and drug-related activities.&quot; Approximately 166 [[active duty]] and [[Reserve components of the United States armed forces|reserve]] U.S. military forces, Department of Defense civilian employees and contractors, and U.S. and foreign law enforcement agency personnel are members of the task force. [http://www.pacom.mil/web/site_pages/staff%20directory/jiatfwest/jiatfwest.shtml]

The [[Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State]] describes the task force's mission as to &quot;[i]n cooperation with U.S. interagency and foreign partners, conduct activities to detect, disrupt, and dismantle drug-related transnational threats in Asia and the Pacific in order to protect U.S. security interests at home and abroad.&quot; [http://www.state.gov/p/inl/rls/137311.htm]

JIATF West lists its &quot;task force partners&quot; as including the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]; the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[National Geospatial Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS); [[United States Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE); and the [[Australian Customs Service]], [[Australian Federal Police]], and [[New Zealand Police]]. [http://www.pacom.mil/web/site_pages/staff%20directory/jiatfwest/jiatfwest.shtml]

The Director of the Task Force is [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] James E. Rendon. [http://www.pacom.mil/web/site_pages/staff%20directory/jiatfwest/jiatfwest.shtml]

==History==
JIATF West was established in 1989 as '''Joint Task Force-Five''' ('''JTF-5'''), headquartered on [[Coast Guard Island]] in [[Alameda, California]]. JTF-5 was created after the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for Fiscal Year 1989 established the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] as the lead agency for the Detection and Monitoring (D&amp;M) of maritime and aerial drug trafficking into the [[United States]] and directed the department to carry out these activities in support of U.S. Law Enforcement activities.  Joint Task Forces Four (JTF-4), Five (JTF-5), and Six (JTF-6) were activated by the department in early calendar year 1989 to carry out this D&amp;M mission.  The mission of the JTFs was expanded by Section 1004 of the 1991 [[National Defense Authorization Act]] to include ten additional specific categories of support that the department could provide to law enforcement agencies.  This authority is in addition to the already assigned mission of D&amp;M and has been continuously re-authorized since 1991.  

In 1994, the newly signed National Interdiction Command and Control Plan (NICCP) redesignated the JTFs as Joint Interagency Task Forces (JIATFs). JTF-5 was redesignated as Joint Interagency Task Force West. JTF-4 was redesignated JIATF East and given responsibility for the [[Caribbean]]. [[Joint Task Force 6]] was redesignated JIATF South and given responsibility for the [[Mexico – United States border]]. (In 1999, JIATF East was merged with JIATF South). 

JTF-5 was designated as Joint Interagency Task Force West in 1994. In 2004, JIATF West was relocated to [[Camp H. M. Smith]] in [[Hawaii]] and collocated with Commander, United States Pacific Command to restructure, refocusing counterdrug efforts exclusively in the Asia-Pacific region. JIATF West serves as the USPACOM's executive agent for all counterdrug and counterdrug-related support to law enforcement in the Asia-Pacific fight against transnational crime.

When he was ten years old, his aunt won a toy [[ventriloquist's dummy]] named &quot;Dummy Dan&quot; in a [[Bingo (card game)|Bingo]] game and gave it to her nephew for [[Christmas]]. He learned ventriloquism, and a year later, his father upgraded the dummy's mouth control from a simple string-and-loop to a lever-system like those used in professional ventriloquist's dummies.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson began taking &quot;Dan&quot; to school, where his fourth-grade teacher allowed him to use the dummy when speaking in front of the class. In this way, Nelson taught himself to overcome his fear of public speaking. He soon started using jokes in his presentation, discovering he could make his classmates laugh.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy/&gt;

He then started performing for church groups, schools and American Legion posts. By the time he was a teenager, he started earning money competing in amateur talent contests held at the local movie theatres, where the prize was five dollars for the most popular act.

==Professional career==
In 1945, Nelson asked famed Chicago ventriloquist figure maker Frank Marshall to make him a professional-quality dummy. Marshall, who had made [[Edgar Bergen|Edgar Bergen's]] ''Charlie McCarthy'' and [[Paul Winchell|Paul Winchell's]] ''Jerry Mahoney'', would only do this after seeing the ventriloquist's work. He came to one of Nelson's theatre performances and was impressed, so sold Nelson a custom-made dummy, which he always carved to bear a resemblance to the ventriloquist.

Nelson gave Dummy Dan's replacement the full name ''Danny O'Day'', which he chose because it contained none of the [[consonants]] impossible for ventriloquists to say without moving the lips, unlike &quot;McCarthy&quot; and &quot;Mahoney&quot;. He then hired a manager and started touring professionally.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy/&gt;

By 1947, Nelson was a professional success and Danny O'Day began to show signs of wear, so Nelson hired Marshall to build him a second one. However, Marshall's hand-carved originals (which he tailored to the personality of the ventriloquist) were impossible to duplicate identically, and Nelson felt the second dummy didn't look sufficiently like Danny to replace him. So he decided to maintain Danny, and added heavy eyebrows, eyeglasses and a beret to the new dummy, creating a foil for Danny named ''Humphrey Higsbye''.

In September 1950, Nelson made his first appearance with Danny on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].

===Farfel the dog===
One night that year, while working a late show in a [[Wichita, Kansas]] nightclub, he picked up a stuffed dog a patron had left on the piano, and improvised a low-pitched voice to make it talk. This gave him the idea for a new character which he had Marshall build. He named it [[Farfel the Dog|Farfel]], after the [[Farfel|Jewish pasta dish]] he had seen on the menu of the [[Borscht Belt]] resorts in [[upstate New York]] where he performed.

===Television career===
In 1950, Nelson was hired as a regular on the [[Texaco Star Theatre]] TV show hosted by [[Milton Berle]]. Nelson and Danny O'Day would appear in [[Texaco]] [[gas jockey]] uniforms.

At one point, he added another animal dummy to his character repertoire, a [[cat]] named ''Ftatateeta'' after a character in [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] play [[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]].

===Nestlé commercials===
In 1955, the Nestlé company hired Nelson to do commercials selling their chocolate candy and [[Nesquik|Nestlé's Quik]] chocolate milk flavoring. The Nestlé executives had him audition by spontaneously performing their newly written [[jingle]]. Nelson sang the first two (musical) lines in Danny's voice:
:''N-E-S-T-L-E-S,''
:''Nestlé's makes the very best...''
He finished with Farfel slowly singing the last word &quot;chocolate&quot;, in two syllables. Nelson was so nervous that his hands sweated, and when Farfel was finished, his finger slipped off the control, causing the mouth to audibly snap shut, a mistake no ventriloquist should make. Nelson left the audition thinking he had blown it, but was surprised to learn he was hired; in fact, the executives actually liked the mouth-snapping effect and asked that he keep it. This became his trademark as the commercials ran for ten years.

When advertising Nestlé's Quik, Danny O'Day would say it &quot;makes milk taste...like a ''million''&quot; (dollars), again slowly and pausing for effect.

===Film career===
In 2009 Nelson was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary ''I'm No Dummy'',&lt;ref name=&quot;I'm No Dummy&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/] IMDB: I'm No Dummy http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Digital Cinema Report&quot;&gt;[http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165] Digital Cinema Report http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Bryan W. Simon]].

==Later years==

Jimmy, and his wife Betty have been residents of Cape Coral, Florida since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Nelson is moving to Cape Coral http://ufdc.ufl.edu/SW10000983/00001&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with Danny and Farfel at local schools and was a long time spokesperson for First Federal Savings and Loan of Fort Myers.

Jimmy Nelson was dubbed in 2011 as &quot;The Dean of American Ventriloquists.&quot;

Jimmy collaborated in 2011 with maker of professional ventriloquist figures [[Tim Selberg]] to produce a character that pays homage to his Danny O'Day.

==Family==
Jimmy and Margot's three boys were twins, Larry and Lee, and Jerry. They lived for many years in Forest Hills, NY and later in Jamaica, NY.

In 1956, Jimmy Nelson married Betty Norman, a night club singer who he worked with and had the remainder of his 3 kids with.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Paiján culture''' was an [[archaeological culture]] that developed on the northern coast of [[Peru]] between 8,700 and 5,900  [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay et al, &quot;The first settlers&quot;, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first described by Peruvian archaeologist [[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] in the 1940s from the Pampa de los Fósiles site.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay, ''The Settlement of the Americas'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research, mainly by French archaeologist Claude Chauchat, identified dozens of open air sites, which include camps, workshops and quarries.&lt;ref&gt;Danièle Lavallée, ''The first South Americans'', pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Most findings are concentrated along the valleys of the rivers Jequetepeque, Cupisnique, Chicama and Moche in the northern coast of Peru; more limited evidences of Paiján presence have been found in the central and south coasts of Peru as well as in the highland site of [[Pre-Columbian Ecuador#El Inga|El Inga]] in Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay, ''The Settlement of the Americas'', pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paiján environment was arid with sparse vegetation and small animals such as rodents, lizards and snails; further resources were provided by the sea which at the time was located 15 kilometers farther than today due to a .lower sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Danièle Lavallée, ''The first South Americans'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; To adapt to this environment, the Paiján developed long needle–like [[projectile point]]s which were mounted on hollow shafts of cane or reed and be used as harpoons to catch fish; they also collected snails, hunted small animals such as [[vizcacha]]s and used grinding stones to process plants.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moseley, ''The Incas and their ancestors'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Paiján sites, dated between 8,600 and 8,000 BCE, indicate large bands that moved seasonally between the coastal plains and the western slopes of the Andes; later sites, dated between 8,000 and 6,500 BCE, evidence smaller groups of decreased mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay et al, &quot;The first settlers&quot;, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to anthropologist [[Tom Dillehay]], a possible explanation for this change is that an amelioration of the climate increased the availability of wild plants and animals; thus, Paiján people required less movement to meet their requirements while still relying on [[hunting-gathering]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay, &quot;Profiles in Holocene History&quot;, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Secret Rapture''''' is a 1988 British play by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]]. Its premiere in the Lyttelton auditorium of the [[Royal National Theatre]] was directed by [[Howard Davies (director)|Howard Davies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/8257/past-events/past-productions-19861990.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/theater/review-theater-bennett-breaks-ground-in-britain-as-aloof-meets-aloof-in-spy-case.html?pagewanted=3|title=Review/Theater; Bennett Breaks Ground in Britain As Aloof Meets Aloof in Spy Case - New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; British revivals of the play have included one at the [[Salisbury Playhouse]] in 2001&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2001/jan/29/theatre.artsfeatures1|title=Theatre review:  The Secret Rapture &amp;#124; Stage &amp;#124; The Guardian|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Lyric Theatre, London]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatreguidelondon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatreguidelondon.co.uk/reviews/secretrapture03.htm|title=Review of The Secret Rapture - 2003|publisher=theatreguidelondon.co.uk|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hare later adapted it as [[The Secret Rapture (film)|1993 film of the same title]], also directed by Davies.

It is set in 1980s Britain and examines the impact of [[Thatcherism]] on personal relationships within the family of a junior government minister after her father's death. Hare states that its title refers to a nun's feeling of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] on being received by God at the moment of her death,&lt;ref name=&quot;curtainup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curtainup.com/secretrapture.html|title=The Secret Rapture,

==Synopsis==
Estranged sisters Isobel and Marion are forced to reunite when their father dies and they must decide how to handle Katherine, their young, alcoholic, mentally unstable stepmother who has been left nothing but the rural home in which they were raised. Isobel and her lover Irwin own a small graphic design company that is struggling to stay afloat. Her sister suggests she and her [[born-again Christian]] husband Tom help them expand the business by finding investors and making Katherine a partner responsible for finding new business. Isobel has grave misgivings about the plan, but finally agrees to it when Marion convinces Irwin of its potential success. Before long, the strain of running the expanded business causes a deterioration in Isobel's relationship with Irwin, who is becoming increasingly dependent upon her, while at the same time Katherine's tenuous hold on sanity begins to unravel.

==Plot==

===Act 1===

====Scene 1====
Isobel is sitting with the body of her father Robert, who has just died. Her elder sister Marion arrives to claim a ring she had given him and the two sisters begin to argue. Marion's husband Tom arrives and Marion leaves, angry with Isobel, then Tom and Isobel talk before leaving.

====Scene 2====
Isobel and her father's second wife, the alcoholic Katherine, sit in the garden of Robert's house just after his funeral. Marion and Tom arrive and an argument begins when Katherine suddenly introduces her idea that she would like to join Isobel's small design firm. Katherine storms out and finds a hidden bottle of drink before returning, whereupon the previously doubtful Isobel agrees that Katherine can join the firm.

====Scene 3====
In the office of Isobel's firm she and her lover Irwin attempt to enjoy a rare evening without Katherine, until Katherine arrives to tell them how she has taken Isobel's friend Max out to dinner. Katherine criticises Irwin's design work before leaving and Irwin tries to convince Isobel to get rid of her. Katherine returns and, when Isobel proves unable or unwilling to eject Katherine, Irwin intervenes and asks Katherine to leave in the morning. Katherine leaves temporarily and Isobel refuses to agree to her ejection from the firm.

====Scene 4====
Back at Robert's house, Marion and Tom try to convince Isobel to let them invest in her firm to help it expand, with Irwin betraying Isobel by supporting them rather than her.

===Act 2===

====Scene 1====
Marion's secretary Rhonda comes round to Isobel's firm's new offices for a shower, and she and Irwin flirt over a bottle of champagne until Isobel arrives back unexpectedly. Rhonda leaves for the shower and Isobel reveals that Katherine has stabbed one of the firm's clients and so has had to be put into a rehab clinic. Isobel and Irwin argue and Rhonda returns to the office before leaving to go to the cinema. Isobel surprises her and Irwin by suggesting that they come too and the three leave together.

====Scene 2====
The expansion of Isobel's firm having failed, Marion and Tom wait in Tom's office, to which Irwin comes for a business meeting. He tells them how Isobel left the cinema halfway through the film and took a spur-of-the-moment holiday to Lanzarote, before returning to care for Katherine. He also admits how he is still in love with Isobel despite the friction that now exists between them and Marion criticises her sister's handling of the situation. Isobel arrives and refuses to come into the office until Irwin leaves. Irwin leaves, Isobel enters and she and Marion argue until Isobel finally leaves. A born-again evangelical Christian, Tom then criticises Marion and leaves to pray for Isobel and Irwin.

====Scene 3====
In the lounge of Katherine's flat, Isobel attempts to make her dinner and the two talk before preparing a sofa-bed for Isobel to stay the night. Katherine leaves for her bedroom and Isobel settles down to read, before Irwin arrives, thanks to Katherine who has secretly disobeyed Isobel and unbolted to door so he can get in. Irwin has brought a gun with him and begs Isobel to sleep with him - she refuses and the pair argue. Katherine returns and Isobel fails to convince her to go out to get the police to eject Irwin. Isobel then prepares to go out and Irwin shoots her just as she leaves.

====Scene 4====
Back at Robert's house, Marion, Tom and Katherine reinstate its furniture and prepare for Isobel's funeral. Katherine leaves and Tom and Marion discuss her emotional difficulties. They then kiss and Tom leaves, before Marion ends the play with an emotional appeal to her dead sister.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Charles Gilbert Sower''' (b. November 21, 1821 [[Norristown, Pennsylvania]])-March 23, 1902) was a printer and publisher in [[Philadelphia]].

==Biography==
He was the great grandson of [[Christopher Sower (younger)|Christopher Sower the younger]], and inherited the family printing and publishing operations. He moved the establishment to Philadelphia in 1844, where he continued publishing, first in his own name, then successively as Sower and Barnes, then as Sower, Barnes and Potts, and then as Sower, Potts and Co. In 1888, 150 years after it was founded by [[Christopher Sower (elder)|Christopher Sower the elder]], the house was incorporated as the Christopher Sower Company by a charter granted by [[Pennsylvania]].

'''''Acoustic Live!''''' is the first [[extended play]] (EP) by American singer [[Adam Lambert]], released on December 6, 2010. The EP features acoustic versions of four songs from Lambert's debut album, [[For Your Entertainment (album)|''For Your Entertainment'']], as well as his show-stopping &quot;Mad World&quot; rendition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamofficial.com/us/news/acoustic-live-out-today |title=Acoustic Live! Out Today &amp;#124; The Official Adam Lambert Site |publisher=Adamofficial.com |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The album has since received mostly positive reviews. Jim Farber of ''NY Daily News'' remarks that Lambert is &quot;downright operatic in 'Soaked' and as wild as Freddie Mercury on 'Music Again.' All the stripped background does is give Lambert more room to trill and soar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2010/11/30/2010-11-30_justin_biebers_my_worlds_acoustic_and_adam_lamberts_acoustic_live_reviews.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Elliptical vs. treadmill: Which will give you the better workout? | first=Jim | last=Farber | date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Savoie of ''Rockstar Weekly'' gave the album 5 out 5 stars, saying that this acoustic EP better displays &quot;the voice that most fell in love with each week during AI&quot; and that it &quot;is the best representation of Lambert’s voice to date and the CD cover resembles some of the greatest punk rock albums of all time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savoie |first=Dan |url=http://www.rockstarweekly.com/cd-review-adam-lambert-acoustic-live.html |title=CD Review: Adam Lambert - Acoustic Live! |publisher=RockStar Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyndsey Parker of ''Reality Rocks'' also praises Lambert, saying that the entire EP &quot;thrillingly places Adam's remarkable vocals front-and-center.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/409301/the-acoustic-live-ep-adam-lamberts-new-unplug-in-baby/ |title=The 'Acoustic Live!'

The tale of wanting to escape from a meaningless existence sounds even more urgent as Lambert attacks his acoustic guitar and gives full-throat to that dramatic tenor voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-12-06-playlist07_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Jerry | last=Shriver | title=Playlist: Adam Lambert's 'Mad World,' plus 10 more | date=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Triteleia grandiflora''''' is a species of [[flowering plant]] known by the common name '''Largeflower Tripletlily '''or''' Wild Hyacinth '''. It is native to western North America from [[British Columbia]] to extreme northern [[California]], eastward into [[Idaho]], [[Montana]] and northern [[Utah]], with [[disjunct distribution|disjunct]] populations occurring in [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=fs&gt;Ladyman, J. (2007). [http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/projects/scp/assessments/triteleiagrandiflora.pdf ''Triteleia grandiflora'': A technical conservation assessment.] US Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bonap.net/MapGallery/County/Triteleia%20grandiflora.png Biota of North America Program, 2013 county distribution map]&lt;/ref&gt; Its habitat includes [[grassland]], [[sagebrush]], woodlands, and forests. It is a perennial herb growing from a [[corm]]. It produces two or three basal leaves up to 70 centimeters long by one wide. The [[inflorescence]] arises on a smooth, erect stem up to 75 centimeters tall and bears an [[umbel]]-like cluster of many flowers. Each flower is a funnel-shaped bloom borne on a [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] up to 4 or 5 centimeters long. The flower may be up to 3.5 centimeters long including the tubular throat and six [[tepal]]s each just over a centimeter long. The inner set of three tepals are somewhat ruffled and broader than the outer tepals. The flower corolla may be deep blue to almost white with a darker blue mid-vein. There are six [[stamen]]s with purple or yellow anthers.

[[File:Triteleia grandiflora 9554.JPG|left|thumb|With tubular throat and six tepals, the flower contains six stamens with purple or yellow anthers.]]
The corm provides food for various wild [[rodent]]s and [[livestock]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[settler]]s found them edible as well.&lt;ref name=fs/&gt;

'''Henry Richard Camelli''' (December 9, 1914 – July 14, 1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[professional baseball]] player.  A [[catcher]], he appeared in [[Major League Baseball]] between {{by|1943}} and {{by|1947}} for the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]]. The native of [[Gloucester, Massachusetts]], stood {{convert|5|ft|11|in}} tall, weighed {{convert|190|lb}} and threw and batted [[right-handed]].

Camelli's professional baseball career stretched over 16 seasons (1935–1948; 1950–1951), with 13 years in [[minor league baseball]] as a player and playing manager, including 1940 when at age 25 he was the catcher/manager of the [[Saginaw Athletics]] of the Class C [[Michigan State League]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=camell001hen Minor league playing record, from [[Baseball Reference]]]&lt;/ref&gt; During one stretch that season, Camelli caught six [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheaders]] in a row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.review-mag.com/archive/550-559/552/Nsports.htm Richard Curry, ''Baseball in Saginaw'']&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared in single games for the 1943 and 1945 Pirates, the latter because of military service&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.tripod.com/bb_catchers/catchers/military.htm Catchers Who Served in the Military]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[United States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://baseballinwartime.com/those_who_served/those_who_served_atoz.htm Baseball in Wartime]&lt;/ref&gt; His best MLB season was {{by|1944}}, when he [[batting average|batted]] .296 with 37 [[hit (baseball)|hits]] and one [[home run]] in 63 games and 125 [[at bats]]. Overall, he appeared in 159 games in all or parts of five Major League campaigns.

On September 30, 1946, he was included in a multiplayer trade that sent him to his hometown Braves with [[third baseman]] [[Bob Elliott (baseball)|Bob Elliott]] for future [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[second baseman]] [[Billy Herman]], [[pitcher]] [[Elmer Singleton]], [[outfielder]] [[Stan Wentzel]] and [[infielder]] [[Whitey Wietelmann]]. Herman was promptly named playing manager of the [[1947 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1947 Pirates]], but he was aghast at the cost — Elliott — the Pirates had paid for him. &quot;Why, they've gone and traded the whole team on me,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;Boston Braves Historical Association Newsletter, Vol. 19, No. 3, Autumn 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Elliott would win the {{by|1947}} [[National League Most Valuable Player]] award and lead Boston to the [[1948 in baseball|1948 National League pennant]]. Herman's 1947 Pirates lost 92 games and finished tied for seventh in the NL, and he resigned before the season's final game.

Camelli was Boston's second-string catcher (behind [[Phil Masi]]) in 1947, his final season in the Majors. The Braves then sent him to the [[San Diego Padres (PCL)|San Diego Padres]] of the AAA [[Pacific Coast League]] for 1948. He died in [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], at the age of 81.

'''Armando Thomas “Mondo” Guerra''' (born June 6, 1978) is a Mexican-American [[fashion designer]] who finished as runner-up on Season 8 of ''[[Project Runway]]'', and later won the series' first All-Stars season.

Guerra was also the first contestant on the show to come from [[Denver]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westword.com/2010-07-29/news/designer-mondo-guerra-plans-to-make-a-splash-as-denver-s-first-contestant-on-project-runway/ Designer Mondo Guerra plans to make a splash as Denver's first contestant on Project Runway - Page 1 - News - Denver - Westword]&lt;/ref&gt; He is a fifth-generation [[Mexican-American]] from the Denver area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_15797477 Ostrow: Denver's reality designer basks in limelight - The Denver Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project Runway==
Guerra was on [[Project Runway (season 8)|the eighth season]] of ''[[Project Runway]]'', aired in 2010. After placing in the top, but not winning, on a number of challenges, then placing in the bottom but not being eliminated in the seventh (Resort Wear Challenge) episode, he won the challenges on the eighth (Jacqueline Kennedy Challenge), ninth (L’Oreal Makeup Challenge) and tenth (HP Pattern Challenge) episodes.

During the tenth challenge, he revealed to the judges that his pattern of bright, bold plus signs on a pant was inspired by his HIV+ status, and that he had been keeping his HIV status a secret for ten years. He also won $20,000 for the ninth challenge, which involved both a “couture” look and a “ready-to-wear” look.

Guerra came in second place in the final competition held at Mercedes Benz Fashion Week at [[Lincoln Center]] in New York City. [[Gretchen Jones]] came in first place, and Andy South came in third.

Project Runway Executive Producer [[Heidi Klum]] (who had pushed for Guerra to win over Jones in a lengthy &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-31749_162-20021138-10391698.html &quot;Project Runway&quot; Season 8 Declares a Winner - Celebrity Circuit - CBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/11/05/tim-gunn-heidi-klum-project-runway-mondo_n_779689.html Tim Gunn: Heidi Asked Me To Tell Other Judges To Vote For Mondo (VIDEO)]&lt;/ref&gt; split debate over the winner) appeared in a modified version of one of Guerra's final collection gowns for the Los Angeles premiere of the movie ''Black Swan''&lt;ref&gt;[http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2010/11/12/exclusive-mondo-guerra-on-designing-a-dress-for-heidi-klum-in-just-one-day/?xid=rss-topheadlines EXCLUSIVE: Mondo Guerra on Designing a Dress for Heidi Klum in Just One Day! – Style News - StyleWatch - People.com]&lt;/ref&gt; a few weeks after the airing of the final episode.

Guerra was the winner of the 2012 series ''[[Project Runway: All Stars|Project Runway: All-Stars]]'', beating out Season 1 designer [[Austin Scarlett]] and fellow Season 8 designer Michael Costello.

==Other Notable Work==
On November 30, 2010, Guerra appeared with [[Liza Minnelli]], [[Kenneth Cole (designer)|Kenneth Cole]] and [[Cheyenne Jackson]] on the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange to ring the opening bell and usher in World AIDS Day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/12/george_bush_has_some_friendly.html George W. Bush Has Some ‘Friendly Advice’ for Congress on World AIDS Day - Daily Intel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in commemoration of World AIDS Day, he designed a limited edition of T-shirts, one with a Day of the Dead sugar skull and one with a tree of life. These shirts were sold on Piperlime.com starting at midnight on  December 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-11-30/living/25001387_1_t-shirts-world-aids-day-aids-research `Runway' designer does T-shirts for World AIDS Day - SFGate]&lt;/ref&gt; For each shirt sold, $20 was donated to amfAR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.timeslive.co.za/lifestyle/fashion/article792119.ece/-i-Project-Runway--i--designer-does-T-shirts-for-World-Aids-Day&lt;/ref&gt; In his statement to Fox News Latino for his motivations in doing this, he said, &quot;“The Day of the Dead is celebration of our loved ones who have passed. When I was thinking of World Aids day I wanted to create something very true to who I am, and what I know. Who I've known and miss and those people in my life that still fight this disease. It’s about love and continuation.” &lt;ref&gt;[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/health/2010/12/01/mondo-designs-dia-los-muertos-t-shirts-world-aids-day/ Mondo Commemorates World AIDS Day with, Um, Skulls - Fox News Latino]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">A category for [[heritage district]]s designated as notable for their use of [[modern architecture]]. 

This category may in some cases include entire cities, such as [[Brasília]], which was recognized as a [[World Heritage Site]] as a notable example of a planned modernist community. 

While many areas contain prominent examples of modern architecture, please add articles on such areas only if they have been officially designated as areas of note, either by local, regional or national governments, or a recognized international body such as [[UNESCO]]. 

Also, please note that the parent category [[:Category:Modernist architecture]] excludes such pre-modern movements as [[expressionist architecture]], [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Art Deco]], so heritage districts noted for those styles should likewise not be categorized here.

The '''Human Resources Administration''' or '''Department of Social Services''' ('''HRA/DSS''') is the department of the [[government of New York City]]&lt;ref&gt;[[New York City Charter]] § 601; &quot;There shall be a department of social services the head of which shall be the commissioner of social services.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in charge of the majority of the city’s social services programs.  HRA helps New Yorkers in need through a variety of services that promote employment and personal responsibility while providing temporary assistance and work supports.  The current Acting Commissioner of HRA is Kathleen Carlson, who was appointed to the position on December 31, 2013 by Deputy Mayor of Health and Human Services [[Lilliam Barrios-Paoli]]. HRA is the largest city social services agency in the [[United States]].  It has a budget of $9.4 billion in 2012 with a planned budget of $9.3 billion in 2013, employs 15,000 people, and serves over 3 million New Yorkers.

==HRA Programs==

===Cash Assistance===

HRA’s Family Independence Administration (FIA) provides temporary cash assistance under the [[Temporary Assistance to Needy Families]] (TANF) program and the [[New York|New York State]] Safety Net program.  Eligibility is based on factors such as income and family size.  Participation in an employment program is required for anyone receiving temporary cash assistance.

===Food Stamps===

The Family Independence Administration also provides access to [[food stamps]] to low-income families, the elderly, and the disabled.  Food stamps are considered a work support, giving working families an increased ability to purchase food.  Unemployed food stamp recipients who are able to work must participate in an employment program.

===Employment Services===

HRA’s Employment Services, a part of the Family Independence Administration, connects HRA clients with employment and training opportunities in the private and public sector.  Many employment services programs combine subsidized work and on-the-job training with guided job hunting and workshops on resume writing and interviewing skills.

===Public Health Insurance===

HRA’s Medical Assistance Program (MAP), part of the Medical Insurance and Community Services Administration (MICSA), provides free or low cost health insurance to New Yorkers who qualify.  Programs include [[Medicaid]], Child Health Plus, the Family Planning Benefit Program and more.

===Long Term Care Services===

The Long Term Care Services Program offers a wide variety of in-home, community based or institutional assistance programs for the elderly and persons with disabilities who need medical care and help with daily tasks.

===Home Care Services===

The Home Care Services Program (HCSP) provides Medicaid-funded care programs to seniors or disabled individuals that allow them to remain safely in their homes, instead of a nursing home or other institution.  Clients must be eligible for Medicaid to receive these services.

===HIV/AIDS Services===

The HIV/AIDS Services Administration (HASA) helps New Yorkers living with [[AIDS]] or [[HIV]] gain access to benefits and support.  HASA clients may receive help with medical care, housing assistance, direct links to other HRA services such as food stamps, employment services, and counseling.  HASA was first created as a unit serving clients with HIV/AIDS in 1985, then expanded into the Division of Aids Services and Income Support in 1995.  In 2000 it became the HIV/AIDS Services Administration.

===Domestic Violence and Emergency Intervention===

The Office of Domestic Violence (ODV) provides support and temporary shelter for victims of [[domestic violence]] and their children.  ODV can provide counseling and advocacy on a client’s behalf, and help them obtain other HRA benefits they are eligible for.

===Adult Protective Services===

Adult Protective Services (APS) provides case management and services for mentally or physically impaired adults who are at risk of harm.  APS assists adults suffering from abuse, neglect, financial exploitation or hazardous living conditions and provides them with service plans that help them live safely within their homes and communities.

===Child Support Enforcement===

The Office of Child Support Enforcement (OCSE) ensures that noncustodial parents pay [[child support]] orders established in family court.  They assist custodial parents in getting a child support order in place, and refer unemployed noncustodial parents to employment services.  OCSE also refers parents to mediation services to resolve disputes and participates in several outreach programs to promote responsible fatherhood

===Energy Assistance===

The Home Energy Assistance Program (HEAP) provides assistance with heating bills and equipment repairs to low-income renters and homeowners.

===Health Insurance Access===

The Office of Citywide Health Insurance Access (OCHIA) connects uninsured New Yorkers with low cost private insurance options or with public health insurance if they are eligible.  OCHIA also works to connect small businesses with affordable private insurance for their employees.  OCHIA operates NYC Health Insurance Link, a website which helps individuals and businesses search for affordable health insurance policies.

==Organization==
New York is divided into fifty-eight local social services districts.&lt;ref name=local-dss-offices&gt;{{cite web|title=Local DSS Offices|publisher=[[New York State Office of Children and Family Services]]|accessdate=21 October 2014|url=http://ocfs.ny.gov/main/localdss.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In New York City, the five boroughs (counties) compose one district, whereas outside of New York City each district corresponds to one county.&lt;ref name=local-dss-offices/&gt;

==History==

===New York Social Services Before HRA===

Social services in some form have existed in New York City since shortly after the first settlers came to what was then the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in the 1600s. Early programs were usually run by churches and private charities.  As an English colony, New York’s social services were based on the [[Elizabethan Poor Law]] of 1598-1601, in which the poor who could not work were cared for in a [[Poorhouse]].  Those who could were employed in a [[Workhouse]].  The first Poorhouse in New York was created in the 1740s, and was a combined Poorhouse, Workhouse, and House of Corrections.

As poverty increased in the 1800s, more private charities and public initiatives were created to deal with the issue.  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many social work-based private charities merged with government agencies, and New York became a leader in developing social work-oriented public service organizations.  The Great Depression was a catalyst for social service organizations to go further in addressing the needs of the poor and unemployed across the nation, and the New Deal led to an expansion in the type and amount of aid provided to low income families, and increased cooperation between public and private social service providers.

===Creation of HRA===

The Human Resources Administration/Department of Social Services was created on August 15, 1966, by consolidating many of the city’s existing social service administrations under Mayor [[John Lindsay]]’s Executive Order No. 28.  The city agencies combined to form HRA included HRA Central Operations and the Department of Welfare, the Manpower and Career Development Agency, the Community Development Agency, Youth Services Agency and Addiction Services Agency.  The Administration initially had two chief officers, the Administrator of the Human Resources Administration and the Commissioner of the Department of Social Services.  In 1970, these positions were combined into the office of Commissioner.  HRA was initially created as a ‘super-agency,’ housing all of the city’s social service programs.  In 1993, the Department of Homeless Services (DHS) became a separate city agency, and in 1996 the Administration for Children’s Services (ACS) was also separated from HRA.

===Welfare Reform===

In 1996, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed the [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] (PRWORA), more commonly known as welfare reform.  This required social services agencies around the country to shift to a work-first philosophy that emphasized job training and employment services combined with temporary aid and work supports.  The [[Aid to Families with Dependent Children]] (AFDC) program was replaced nationwide with [[Temporary Assistance to Needy Families]] (TANF).  In 1998, the first phase of welfare reform was implemented in New York City under HRA Commissioner Jason Turner.  The Agency’s Income Support Centers were converted to Job Centers.  Since the implementation of reforms in New York City, the Cash Assistance Caseload has declined to its lowest level since 1964, while enrollment in work support programs like Food Stamps has increased.

'''Sir Robert Furnese, 2nd Baronet''' (1 August 1687 – 7 March 1733) was an English politician who sat in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|British House of Commons]] from 1708 until his death.&lt;ref name=CB&gt;Cokayne, George Edward (1906) ''[https://archive.org/details/cu31924092524416 Complete Baronetage]''. Volume V. Exeter: W. Pollard &amp; Co. {{LCCN|06023564}}. pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furnese was the son of [[Sir Henry Furnese, 1st Baronet]], of Gunnersbury House, and his first wife Anne Brough, daughter of Robert Brough.&lt;ref name=VCH&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63610 &quot;Parishes: Waldershare&quot;], ''The History and Topographical Survey of the County of Kent'': Volume 10 (1800), pp. 50–61.  Retrieved 17 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at [[Eton College]], and spent some time in Germany as a young man.&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Handley, Stuart (2004) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/63007 &quot;Furnese, Sir Henry, first baronet (1658–1712)&quot;], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, {{doi|10.1093/ref:odnb/63008}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 December 1708, shortly after his return from the Continent, Furnese was elected [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Truro (UK Parliament constituency)|Truro]] in a by-election.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He held the seat until the [[British general election, 1710]], when he was elected [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] MP for [[New Romney (UK Parliament constituency)|New Romney]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; He held the seat over four parliaments until 1727.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; He inherited the [[Furnese baronets|baronetcy]] and a large estate on the death of his father on 30 November 1712.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; Politically, he was a supporter of [[Robert Walpole]].&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; In the [[British general election, 1727]], he was elected MP for [[Kent (UK Parliament constituency)|Kent]] and held the seat through that parliament until his death aged 45 in 1733.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt;

Furnese was married three times. His first wife was his stepsister Anne Balam, the daughter of his father's second wife Matilda Vernon and her first husband Anthony Balam.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; They married on 1 October 1708&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; and had one daughter, Anne, who married the Hon. John St John, son of [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount St John]].&lt;ref name=VCH/&gt; Anne, Lady Furnese, died on 29 May 1713 aged 25.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; His second marriage on 8 July 1714 was to Arabella Watson, daughter of [[Lewis Watson, 1st Earl of Rockingham]].&lt;ref name=CB/&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt; She was the mother of Furnese's only son Henry and his second daughter Catherine, who married her first cousin [[Lewis Watson, 2nd Earl of Rockingham]].&lt;ref name=VCH/&gt; Arabella died on 5 September 1727.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; He married thirdly, on 15 May 1729 at [[Teddington]], [[Middlesex]], Lady Anne Shirley, daughter of [[Robert Shirley, 1st Earl Ferrers]].&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; By his last wife, he left a daughter Selina who married [[Sir Edward Dering, 6th Baronet|Edward Dering]].&lt;ref name=VCH/&gt; They had one other daughter who predeceased her father.&lt;ref name=ODNB/&gt;

Furnese died on 7 March 1733 at [[Waldershare]], [[Kent]], and was succeeded by his son Henry.&lt;ref name=CB/&gt; According to a contemporary, he died &quot;by his own fault, for he had one of those colds hanging on him and he drank so hard that he was not sober for ten days before he was taken ill&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Hastings MSS'', vol. III, p. 15, quoted in Handley, Stuart (2002) [http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1690-1715/member/furnese-robert-1687-1733 &quot;FURNESE, Robert (1687-1733), of Waldershare, Kent, and Dover Street, Westminster&quot;], in ''The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1690-1715'', Boydell &amp; Brewer.

1- Dear Mr/Mrs. Whpq, I have the permission to add that contents to Wikipedia, and They are not copyrighted material without permission.I can provide Wikipedia with all kinds of evidence from www.desphilic.com. Please do not edit pages without concern at least such a major destruction!  or you will be blocked from editing.

2- Desphilic is almost the only Persian Romanization site which is still alive. It definitely deserves a separate page in Wikipedia.
  
3- If this census has a primary leader or judge or jurry, plz that leader be responsible to look for consultancy  about the topic from an expert. The contents should not be judged without comments from an expert.

4- The contents, if compared to Chinese Romanization should be considered with the following issues taken in mind:

41- Chinese have more than 3000 alphabet letters, while Perso-Arabic has only 32 which amongst them 10 are repetitions.

42- Chinese have 1/4 of the world population, Perso-Arabic Persian users are only 70 Million.

43- Desphilic is a new and under-development standard. however currently there are  1000 results in Google.

It is obvious that you must find more results for pinyin. and of course its wiki page is larger.

5- The issues that criticizers have talked about all are about quantitative matters. none of them have had a qualitative and content based analysis.  &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:I masoomi|I masoomi]] ([[User talk:I masoomi|talk]] • [[Special:Contributions/I masoomi|contribs]]) 10:17, 23 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt; &lt;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&gt;

*'''Reply''' - [1] Copyrighted material cannot be added to Wikipedia without confirmation of permission.  If you do have permission, then you need to follow the instructions for [[WP:DCP|donating copyrighted material]].
** [2] - Being nearly the only Persian Romanization website around is not a reason for keeping this article unless it can be shown that this fact makes the site notable through coverage in reliable sources.
** [3] - This discussion does not have a specific leader.  It is a community discussion, although an uninvolved administrator will make a decision at the end based on this discussion.  As for judgment from an expert, if anybody can out forth evidence from experts that Desphilic is a notable Persian romanisation, then that would be a strong argument for keeping the article.
** [4] - Pointing to the Chinese language was not to compare the details of the language, but rather show that coverage about Chinese Romanisation exists in reliable sources.  A search in Google Books for [[pinyin]] or [[Wade-Giles]] shows plenty of sources that write about these systems of Romansiation.. whereas there is absolutely no results for Desphilic. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 12:02, 23 November 2010 (UTC)

:*'''Disputed'''. The article has 12 right now, which is more than 2 (the minimum).

::The article already passed the bar for [[Wikipedia:Notability (music)]] with www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net &amp; www.thrashmag.com. IMO the www.freedb.org &amp; bmi references are window dressing -- virtually no one will get anything out of them by clicking on them. Now up to 14 citations.

::: blabbermouth might be good so taht might be one good source. www.thrashmag.com is &quot;publications where the musician or ensemble talks about themselves&quot; so doesn't count www.freedb.org and bmi are not non trivial coverage in independent reliable sources. The count of citations means nothing, it's their content. [[User:Duffbeerforme|duffbeerforme]] ([[User talk:Duffbeerforme|talk]]) 09:16, 23 November 2010 (UTC)
::::Which I have no arguement with, but this AfD was started when there were zero sources. Do you still consider the article somehow lacking, and if so, why? This isn't &quot;my&quot; article, and I really don't have much affinity for the group other than it's a CT article and that they are notable. [[User:Markvs88|Markvs88]] ([[User talk:Markvs88|talk]]) 15:08, 23 November 2010 (UTC)
:::::Sorry Markvs, but none of the references you added pass the bar at [[WP:RS]]. Duff is correct. And Blabbermouth, those are somewhat trustworthy notifications at best, but it's really just a noticeboard for press releases. Now, Loki, below, has added some more relevant stuff.

The '''Hiram Price/Henry Vollmer House''' is located on the Brady Street Hill in [[Davenport, Iowa]], [[United States]].   It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1983.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;   The home is named for two members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who lived in the house, Hiram Price and Henry Vollmer.  The building is now a part of the campus of [[Palmer College of Chiropractic]].

== Hiram Price==
{{Main| Hiram Price}}

Hiram Price (1810–1901) is a native of [[Washington County, Pennsylvania]] and moved to Davenport in 1844.  He became a businessman in the city and became involved in local politics.  He was an advocate of the [[Temperance movement|Temperance Movement]] and worked to pass the prohibition of liquor in the state of [[Iowa]].  He also was involved in establishing the railroads in Iowa.  Politically, he was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] until they tried to force slavery in [[Kansas]].  At that time he helped to form the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in Iowa.  He supported Iowa’s governor, [[Samuel Kirkwood]], by raising both men and money to support the Union cause during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].  Price represented the second district of Iowa in congress twice, 1861–1869 and 1877-1880. In 1881 he was appointed Commissioner of Indian Affairs by President [[James Garfield]].  He died in [[Washington, DC]] in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.celticcousins.net/scott/1910vol2bios7.htm#price|title= Hiram Price|publisher= Scott County Iowa USGenWeb Project|accessdate=2010-11-16|first=|last=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Henry Vollmer ==
{{Main| Henry Vollmer }}

Henry Vollmer (1867–1930) is a native of Davenport who was an attorney and served the city as its mayor from 1893-1896.&lt;ref name= Svendsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Svendsen, Marls A.|first=Bowers, Martha H|title=Davenport where the Mississippi runs west: A Survey of Davenport History &amp; Architecture |volume= |year=1982 |publisher=City of Davenport|location=Davenport, Iowa|page=7-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During his term as mayor the streets in the older part of town were paved and the current [[Davenport City Hall|city hall]] was built.  The city was also able to weather the financial panic of 1893.  Vollmer won a special election in 1914 to the House of Representatives to fill the seat of [[Irvin S. Pepper]], who died in office.  Unlike Price, Vollmer did not support the prohibition of alcohol.  He died in California.

==Architecture==
The house was built by Price in 1870.  It is a two-story [[Italianate]] structure built of brick.  The dominate feature of the house is the three-story entrance tower.  The arched windows have decorative hoods.  Bracketed [[eaves]] and a [[hip roof|hipped roof]] top the house.

'''Kazhiyur''' or Kaliyur is a small village on the way from Kancheepuram to Cheyyar. Kancheepuram is the District headquarters in Tamil Nadu state of Southern India.

==Clan==

The clans who have this small village as their place of origin have the name of the [[village]] added to their name as their last name.

I fail to see how this is a [[WP:N|notable]] event in any sense of the word. Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, [[WP:NOTNEWS|not a news archive]], and this is purely news. The fact that it has had international coverage is great and all, but in the end, it is simply not encyclopedic material. In a few months this is not going to be remembered at all, and thus it has no enduring notability at all. This was just yet another fire that for some reason caught the attention of today's media. That last half does not contribute anything to notability (and our policies only mention that it might indicate notability, not that it does).

:Hmm, Are there any specific policies on the notability of disasters?  I'm fairly certain that it's pretty common practice to keep articles on catastrophes of this scale.  That's 50+ deaths in on incident.  Anyway, there's tones of articles of accidents of a similar nature, see  [[:CATEGORY:2010 fires]] for just a few.  In that light, not only do I vote '''Keep''', but I propose that this AfD be dropped as per [[WP:SNOW]].--[[User:Johnsemlak|Johnsemlak]] ([[User talk:Johnsemlak|talk]]) 18:28, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

::Disasters? It's a fire. I looked at the category; surely you can agree with me when I argue that there's a little bit of a difference between a power plant explosion or a church burning and an apartment fire. One of them happens every day, one of them does not. What the media happens to decide is relevant is not only something a coin flip might be able to tell you, but also something that should ''not'' impact what Wikipedia is. --[[User:Shirik|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#005&quot;&gt;Sh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#007&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#009&quot;&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00A&quot;&gt;ik&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Shirik|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#88C&quot;&gt;Questions or Comments?&lt;/span&gt;]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:59, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

*'''Keep''' It's just as much crystal-balling to say that &quot;In a few months this is not going to be remembered at all&quot; as it is to say that it will be remembered.  I'd argue for the latter, however, based on the observation that [[skyscraper fire]]s get written about more than most fires, in large part because of the difficulty in fighting them and in rescuing people from them.  [http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=active&amp;tbo=1&amp;tbs=bks:1&amp;q=%22skyscraper+fires%22&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=].

*'''Strong keep'''. Fires and other incidents involving public buildings in China resulting in more than 50 deaths are quite uncommon, and do not occur every year, yet an image for this article would be helpful. For example, though not a fire, the [http://www.uzbekistannews.net/story/527290 collapse] of a building in [[Shijiazhuang]] last year claimed 17 lives. The fire in Shanghai occurred in a very high-population density residential metropolitan area in China's largest city, comparable to the [[Beijing Television Cultural Center fire]] last year which killed one person yet has quite an extensive article. ~&lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;[[User:AstroHurricane001/A|A]][[User:AstroHurricane001|H]][[User:AstroHurricane001/D|1]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sup&gt;([[User:AstroHurricane001/T|T]][[Special:Contributions/AstroHurricane001|C]][[User:AstroHurricane001/U|U]])&lt;/sup&gt; 01:14, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' per above. It is very rare that a fire results in this much damage and so many deaths; it is also prompting Chinese authorities to implement stricter fire safety regulations.

'''William Towers MP''' is the Home Secretary in the ninth and tenth series of the BBC television drama ''[[Spooks]]''. He is portrayed by actor [[Simon Russell Beale]]. Towers is appointed after the election of the [[Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement|Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government]].

In the tenth series, he has Harry's tribunal stopped and reinstates him as Head of Section D. He reveals that this is because the death of [[Osama Bin Laden]] and the revolutions in the [[Middle East]] were causing a new chain of events that could end up with fundamentalist taking power and therefore declaring state support for terrorist organizations. As a bid to separate themselves from the US's negative image, the UK is attending a secret summit with Russia to discuss a new special relationship between their two countries. Towers was responsible for bringing Ilya and Elena Gavrik into the country so as to prepare the negotiations. 

In the third episode, he asks [[Ruth Evershed]] to dinner where he offers her a job as his new security adviser, a job she accepts in episode four and takes up in the fifth episode.

Although Towers is through and through a politician and clashes with Harry when intelligence matters rivals with the UK's current interests, he is one of Harry's strongest allies and always indulges him as much as he can. He even said in their first meeting that he considered him a hero. It was only reluctantly that Towers handed him over to the CIA in the tenth series and he promised to support him in whatever decision he made about his future at MI5 after Ruth's death.

::There are many problems with this stub. The name is appropriate for a broad article on [[combinatorial optimization]] on [[partially ordered set]]s or [[semilattice]]s. The existing stub describes only some engineering professor's heuristic, giving a vague account that does not even claim notability and does not distinguish the content from numerous approaches to similar problems (e.g., [[Ingram Olkin|Olkin]], Gibbons, et alia on ''Selecting and Ordering Populations'', etc.) Thanks.

The '''Renwick Building''' is located in downtown [[Davenport, Iowa]], [[United States]].  It has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1983,&lt;ref name=nris/&gt; and on the [[Davenport Register of Historic Properties]] since 2000.&lt;ref name=DRHP_list/&gt; It is known locally for the large painted sign on the north side of the building depicting the [[Bix 7 Road Race and Memorial Jazz Festival|Bix 7 Road Race]].  The NRHP incorrectly lists the building’s address as 322 Brady Street, which is the building next door.   This structure is 324 Brady Street.

==History ==
The building was built by its namesake William Renwick, who was a prosperous Davenport industrialist in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=qcmemory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davenportlibrary.com/files/7413/2510/2626/324-328_Brady_St.pdf|title=Renwick Building|publisher=[[Davenport Public Library]]|accessdate=2010-11-16|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mansion is also on the National Register of Historic Places as a part of the [[St. Katherine's Historic District]].  The building has housed various furniture stores over the years.  Davenport Furniture was the first business to occupy the structure after it was built.  It was followed by Drake Furniture and Carpet, Iowa Furniture &amp; Carpet Co. and Freeman-Glickman.  Matthew’s Office Supply occupied the building until 2005.  The building sat empty until 2012 when Restoration St. Louis, who also renovated the [[Forrest Block]] and the [[Hotel Blackhawk]], began a $4.5 million renovation of the building.&lt;ref name=Allemeier&gt;{{cite news|author=Kurt Allemeier|title= Renwick Building's $4.5M renovation begins|publisher=''[[Quad-City Times]]''|date= 2012-01-24|url= http://qctimes.com/news/local/renwick-building-s-m-renovation-begins/article_e60242b4-46d3-11e1-9cf0-0019bb2963f4.html|accessdate= 2012-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Apartments will be housed on the upper floors and commercial space will occupy the main floor. 

==Architecture ==
The Renwick Building is a steel frame and [[brick]] commercial building.&lt;ref name=qcmemory/&gt; The four-story building reflects the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago Commercial Style]].  The brick [[façade]] acts as the building’s skin around the steel frame, which supports the structure.   This technology allowed a greater expanse of windows, which are found in this building.  Decorative elements are found at the top of the building.  Round arch windows in a tri-partite configuration line the fourth floor on the facade, and the building is topped with a heavy ornate [[cornice]].

Possible [[WP:HOAX|hoax]]. A simple search for &quot;jasri&quot; and &quot;lakshadweep&quot; (the place this language is apparently spoken) results in eight Ghits, and of those, the only hit with ''slight'' merit is [http://travel.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?263605 this], but it's a travel blog that mentions it in the comment section (where it is described as a &quot;cocktail language&quot;, whatever that is). A subsequent search for &quot;jasri&quot; and &quot;creole&quot; results in slightly more hits but they never use both words in the same context. '''Erpert''' &lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Erpert|(let's talk about it)]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:36, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' - after searching several times for sources, very little has turned up to even substantiate that this may be the local name for a dialect. It seems doubtful that this is a distinct language. With a lack of sources I cannot recommend a merge as an alternative to deletion.

*'''Delete''' Unverifiable at best, very likely a hoax. [[User:Edward321|Edward321]] ([[User talk:Edward321|talk]]) 12:15, 19 November 2010 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt;'''I'm not sure'''&lt;/s&gt;. '''Keep'''. Until recently, the article [[Lakshadweep]] called this language &quot;Jeseri&quot;. I can't find anything related at Ethnologue, but the name &quot;Jeseri&quot; is mentioned at [http://india.gov.in/knowindia/ut_lakshadweep.php india.gov.in], in a context that seems relevant. So maybe this is not really a hoax, but just a poorly referenced stub. --[[User:Amire80|Amir E. Aharoni]] ([[User talk:Amire80|talk]]) 07:59, 21 November 2010 (UTC)
*'''Keep''' but move to '''Jeseri language''' as that appears to be the most common form.

'''Francis Ogboro''' is 
the New President of [[Nigeria]] Polo Federation.

Amongst other candidates he also competed against former Kaduna polo vice president, Alhassan Dantata.

Elections took place on the 12 November 2010 at Kaduna Polo Club Nigeria. He won victoriously by 48 votes to 1.

Francis Ogboro was born 26 September 1954 in [[Igarra]], [[Edo State]], Nigeria. He is the 2nd Child in a family of seven. He is married to Tonia Ogboro.

He started riding at the age of nine in Zaria before he went to the United Kingdom. Francis took up a bit of riding there (UK) but because of studies, he
couldn't ride as much as he would have loved to at that time.
When he came back to Nigeria finally, a close friend advised him to take up riding more seriously and he started playing polo as early as 1994.

Francis Ogboro started business in 1979 in the [[UK]]. Initially, he was supplying uniforms to the Nigerian Army and Nigerian Police. 
He made some money and thought he would make some investments where he lived at that time.

Being involved with so many people in the UK, he met a friend who was trying to sell off his restaurants and return to Marbella, Spain at that time. 
The restaurant was on [[Queensway]], a very popular street in London. It was very well known to Nigerians, especially those who visited the UK regularly.

They patronized it a lot. He bought one there and another one in an area called [[Fulham]] in [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] from the same person. 
He also had two health clubs. 
But when he wanted to relocate, He sold some and retained a couple of them. Since those businesses were cash-oriented and it was very difficult to keep tabs on them, so he decided to sell them and invest his money in Nigeria.

He also has Rockshell International, which is a consultancy outfit. Francis is the Managing Director of Options International, which is involved in telecoms.
Options International has built exchanges for Nitel in the past and does private work now. 
Francis Ogboro is also the Chairman of a trading outfit that imports generators and air-conditioners. One of the companies is called HBM and the other is RS. He is also the Chairman of Bimbo detergent.

The '''Union Electric Telephone &amp; Telegraph''' building is located just north of downtown [[Davenport, Iowa]], [[United States]].   It has been listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] since 1983.&lt;ref name=nris/&gt;  It is on the same block as the [[Jacob Raphael Building]], which is also listed on the NRHP.

==History==
Telephone service in the city of Davenport was initiated in 1878 when a private line was installed between the Davenport Water Company office and plant.&lt;ref name= Svendsen&gt;{{cite book|last=Svendsen, Marls A.|first=Bowers, Martha H|title=Davenport where the Mississippi runs west: A Survey of Davenport History &amp; Architecture |volume= |year=1982 |publisher=City of Davenport|location=Davenport, Iowa|page=8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year  36 subscribers in Davenport, [[Rock Island, Illinois|Rock Island]] and [[Moline, Illinois]] were hooked up to a switchboard.  That area was expanded to 41 towns along the [[Mississippi River]] by the Western Telephone Company in 1881.  Iowa Telephone and Telegraph was organized the next year and started to serve Davenport residents.  Union Electric Telephone and Telegraph entered the market in 1902 and they built this building.  They had about 1,400 customers, but they ceased operations in 1912.&lt;ref name= Svendsen/&gt;

==Architecture==
The utility company built this building for its use on the corner of Harrison and Sixth Streets.  It is a brick building on a stone foundation.  The two-story structure sits on a raised basement.  A staircase rises to the main entrance in the center of the main level.  A decorative hood crowns the entrance.  Four [[pilasters]] adorn the façade on the first and second levels.  They are capped by Corinthian capitals.  The façade is crowned with an imposing [[pediment]].  The window openings feature roman arched windows on the second floor that are capped with a hood and a decorative keystone.&lt;ref name= Svendsen/&gt;

The '''Stits-Besler Executive''' is a three place [[homebuilt aircraft]] designed by [[Ray Stits]], as the '''Stits SA-4A Executive'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;aerofiles St&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aerofiles.com/_st.html |title=American airplanes: st - sz |publisher=Aerofiles.com |date=2009-11-02 |accessdate=2011-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The project was initiated when William Besler of [[Besler Corp.]] contracted Ray Stits to design a 3 place homebuilt aircraft with folding wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Experimenter|title=Stits-Besler Executive|date=March 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besler was an early aviation experimenter, who had mounted a steam engine of his own design on a [[Travel Air 2000]] in 1933.

==Design==
The wings on the Executive fold aft and upward. Fuel tanks are embedded in the non-folding wing roots. The [[fuselage]] is welded steel tube with [[Aircraft fabric covering|fabric covering]]. The [[aileron]]s are mounted in the center of the wing rather than the tips.

==Operational history==
The sole Executive, (registration no. N36K), has been used as a test bed for Besler designed engines; a {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[Steam aircraft|steam engine]] and a two cycle, four cylinder Vee rated at {{convert|100|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|magazine=Experimenter|pages=6|date=April 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contested [[WP:PROD]]. Prod reasoning was that [[WP:NOTDIC|Wikipedia is not a dictionary]] of slang or jargon. As another user noted on the talk page, this is a ''term'' not a ''topic''.  Article has been edited since then but still lacks even a single source. While sources can be found that use this term, it is doubtful there are sources that actually discuss the term itself. [[Wiktionary]] has an entry on this already, and since this is unsourced transwiki is not a good option anyway. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 18:52, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
*&lt;small class=&quot;delsort-notice&quot;&gt;'''Note''':  This debate has been included in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Language|list of Language-related deletion discussions]]. &lt;!--Template:Deletion sorting--&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;—[[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 18:56, 16 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/small&gt;
*'''Comment'''. Yes it's an unviable dicdef, but what to do with it? The two primary Wiktionary entries appear to be [[wikt:number-crunching]] and [[wikt:number cruncher]], but they only have 1 definition each. Could some of the material here be transferred? Should we [[WP:Soft redirect]] from here to there? -- [[User:Quiddity|Quiddity]] ([[User talk:Quiddity|talk]]) 19:32, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
:As I said, as this material is not [[WP:V|verified]] by sources so transwiki is not a good option. We shouldn't dump our garbage in the neighbor's yard. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 19:41, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
*'''Redirect'''. Make a [[WP:SRD|soft direct]]. (As said above). [[User:Endofskull|Endofskull]] ([[User talk:Endofskull|talk]]) 22:26, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

*'''Improve''' or '''Delete ''without prejudice against subsequent recreation'''''.  This is undoubtedly a crap article - it's just awful.  I have no problem with removing it ''on grounds of being crap''.  However, I strongly believe that this is a perfectly good title/subject for an article - and Wikipedia definitely needs a decent article with this title.  So if we do remove it, I want to be quite certain that we do not use that as a precedent for removing some future article of the same name.  This is not (as some have asserted) a WP:NOTDICT issue.
: The phrases &quot;Number cruncher&quot; and &quot;Number crunching&quot; are technical terms that are widely used in the computer industry and which have been around in common an frequent use over at least three decades.  It is argued that the term is 'slang' or 'jargon' - but that's true of so many words and phrases used in this young industry that we can't just say &quot;NO JARGON!&quot; - if we did that then we'd have to delete [[byte]], [[nibble]], [[floppy disk]], [[netbook]] and hundreds of other articles that take their title from a jargon word for some object or concept that has become mainstream.  Nobody calls a &quot;floppy disk&quot; a &quot;flexible media diskette&quot; - they use the jargon word because it's easier.  A number cruncher is a class of computer that's optimized for large-scale arithmetic processing - and we have no other word that describes such machines (&quot;Supercomputer&quot; comes close - but not all supercomputers are number crunchers...and vice-versa).  We should have an article that describes notable number crunchers - what makes a number cruncher special - what attributes it needs.  &quot;Number cruncher&quot; should be considered as a phrase of comparable significance to &quot;[[Web server]]&quot;, &quot;[[Netbook]]&quot; or &quot;[[Laptop]]&quot; - who's articles are never likely to be nominated here.
: Similarly, the phrase &quot;Number crunch'''ing'''&quot; describes what a computer program is doing when it's doing a lot of purely arithmetic work (&quot;Steve, why has your program stopped running?&quot; &quot;It hasn't stopped, it's just doing a lot of number crunching.&quot;)  The phrase is comparable to words like &quot;sorting&quot;, &quot;rendering&quot; or &quot;parsing&quot; - which have articles about their root words.  Once again, there is no other word or convenient phrase that precisely conveys the meaning of &quot;number crunching&quot; - and we could certainly write an article about the nature of this activity - why some applications are heavy number crunch processes, etc.  As our article points out, the term is also used outside of the computing industry (as in &quot;Let's go crunch the numbers before we present it to the CEO&quot;) - and in that case, it probably should be considered slang.  But the phrase has a precise meaning in computer science and it's a part of the mainstream vocabulary of that industry. [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] ([[User talk:SteveBaker|talk]]) 02:37, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
::Floppy disk has 35 references cited. Netbook has ''93''. This article has zero. Therein lies the difference. Honestly I was only aware of this term as slang for an accountant, similar to [[bean counter]], but if it is as widely used as you say for a specifically modified computer then sources [[WP:V|verifying]] that should be available and the article can be fixed through editing it to reflect the information in the sources. I never mind being proved wrong at AFD and seeing a crappy article turned in to a good one, but some actual proof is going to be needed. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 02:49, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
:::I agree - the article sucks and should probably be removed/redirected/whatever'ed.  As I !voted, I'm not averse to removing it on grounds of general crappitude - so long as it is '''not''' done on WP:NOTDICT grounds which would mitigate against future recreation of a much better article. [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] ([[User talk:SteveBaker|talk]]) 13:11, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
* Comparisons to [[byte]] and the like fall flat because those are literally jargon and incomprehensible to outsiders. &quot;Number cruncher&quot; is trivially worked out through its axioms, and is used in so many different contexts that it does little more than connote heavy calculation work. Figures of speech which are not examined in detail by multiple independent reliable sources don't need their own articles. [[user:thumperward|Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward: not at work)]] - [[user talk:thumperward|talk]] 06:20, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
::Imagine an article that described specific computers that were designed to be good number crunchers and listed the properties they collectively have.  Such an article (which I wish we had) would be as appropriate as (say) [[netbook]] or [[web server]].  The present article isn't that - and should probably 'go away' - but that doesn't mean that a perfectly reasonable article on this topic couldn't be written in the future. [[User:SteveBaker|SteveBaker]] ([[User talk:SteveBaker|talk]]) 13:11, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
::: Not really. &quot;Number cruncher&quot; is a fairly genericised label applied to a disparate collection of things to carry a general connotation. &quot;Web server&quot; and &quot;netbook&quot; are specific categories of actual products, and indeed are the primary names for their respective subjects. [[user:thumperward|Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward: not at work)]] - [[user talk:thumperward|talk]] 15:03, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
:::'''Comment''' - We already have an article on the class of computers used for number crunching.  It's called a [[supercomputer]].  However, the appellation of &quot;number cruncher&quot; to this class of machine is unsubstantiated. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 15:07, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
* '''Redirect''' I like an idea of soft redirect to ''wiktionary'' (but without moving any unverified material there). [[User:Ipsign|Ipsign]] ([[User talk:Ipsign|talk]]) 08:10, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
*: Transwiki has been requested: I'd be happy with replacing the current page with a {{tl|wi}} once that's done. [[user:thumperward|Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward: not at work)]] - [[user talk:thumperward|talk]] 15:03, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
::I still think that is probably not appropriate. I'm not real familiar the the policies over there but I assume they require some form of verification, which this article is entirely lacking having never had a single source. I don't object to deleting the article and immediately recreating it as a soft redirect, but I don't think we should look at Wikitionary as a dumping ground for unsourced material. [[User:Beeblebrox|Beeblebrox]] ([[User talk:Beeblebrox|talk]]) 19:13, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
::: Oh, by all means if Wiktionary rejects the transwiki then deletion is fine. [[user:thumperward|Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward: not at work)]] - [[user talk:thumperward|talk]] 14:03, 18 November 2010 (UTC)
*'''Delete''' as a dictionary definition.  the whole thing is a mixed bag of uses. -- [[User:Whpq|Whpq]] ([[User talk:Whpq|talk]]) 15:07, 17 November 2010 (UTC)
:''The above discussion is preserved as an archive of the debate.  &lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;'''Please do not modify it.'''&lt;/span&gt; Subsequent comments should be made on the appropriate discussion page (such as the article's talk page or in a [[Wikipedia:Deletion review|deletion review]]).

This article lists the ten most populous cities in Japan by decade, starting after the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868.  The first Japanese Census was not conducted until 1920, but other civilian and military population counts were carried out in the prior years between 1872 and 1918, and those form the source data for this article.  When data is not available right on the turn of the decade, the closest year is used.

== 1873 ==
In 1868, the [[Meiji Restoration]] deposed the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] and founded the [[Empire of Japan]]. &lt;!--The Shogunate had conducted municipal population counts only irregularly and inconsistently, so the new government assembled the Japanese Topographical Outline (日本地誌提要) to take stock of the country.  It not only lists the population of all major cities and towns by region, but documents natural features such as bodies of water, mountains, wilderness expanses, and natural harbors.--&gt;  Many major cities had lost population since the Tokugawa Era, as [[samurai]] left the former castle towns after the collapse of the military order.  &lt;!--1873 is the first year for which consistent population data exists for all significant municipalities countrywide.--&gt;

Source data is from &quot;Nihon Chishi Teiyo&quot; (日本地誌提要, the Japanese Topographical Outline).

In 1888, the government enacted a sweeping overhaul of the municipal government system, part of which involved a drastic program of municipality mergers. Overall, the [[Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan|&quot;Great Meiji Mergers&quot;]] cut the number of municipalities in Japan by more than three quarters, while dramatically increasing the size of many cities as they absorbed their surrounding towns and villages.

== 2010 ==
In the mid-2000s, another series of municipal mergers was enacted.  The [[Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan|&quot;Great Heisei Mergers&quot;]] nearly halved the number of municipalities in Japan, once again increasing the size of some cities significantly and creating new towns and cities.  Despite a mounting population loss in rural areas and some smaller cities, Japan's major cities continue to grow.

'''Colorado National Speedway''' is a paved oval in Dacono, [[Colorado]] spanning {{convert|0.375|mi|km}}. The track is currently a member of the NASCAR [[Whelen All-American Series]] and hosts the NASCAR [[NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West|K&amp;N Pro Series West]] annually.

==History==

It hosted the [[NASCAR]] [[Camping World Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]] during its first three seasons, 1995 through 1997. The [[1995 Total Petroleum 200]] featured a last lap battle where [[Butch Miller (racing driver)|Butch Miller]] edged out [[Mike Skinner (racing driver)|Mike Skinner]] by .001 second for his only series win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boodman 1995 Total Petroleum 200&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/race/1995_Total_Petroleum_200/C|title=1995 Total Petroleum 200|last=Boodman|first=Alan|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is listed as the closest finish in series history, although the video replay of the race may dispute that measurement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kmMzCofhj0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1996 Colorado 200]] saw Skinner dominate leading the final 220 laps and beat Miller by .7 seconds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boodman 1996 Colorado 200&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/race/1996_Colorado_200/C|title=1996 Colorado 200|last=Boodman|first=Alan|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Hornaday, Jr.]] won the final race in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boodman CNS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/tracks/Colorado_National_Speedway|title=Race Results at Colorado National Speedway - Racing-Reference.info|last=Boodman|first=Alan|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the 1998 season, Colorado was dropped from the schedule in favor of [[Pikes Peak International Raceway]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]], which hosted the series until 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boodman Pikes Peak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://racing-reference.info/tracks/Pikes_Peak_International_Raceway|title=Race Results at Pikes Peak international Raceway - Racing-Reference.info|last=Boodman|first=Alan|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASCAR K&amp;N Pro Series West has raced at Colorado eight times since 1995 with [[Mike Duncan (race car driver)|Mike Duncan]] and [[Eric Holmes (race car driver)|Eric Holmes]] tied for most-series wins at two each.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boodman CNS&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Suzy (Suzanne) Post''', [[Louisville, Kentucky]] (1933- ) is an award-winning civil rights activist in the struggle against [[discrimination]] and [[social injustice]] in [[Kentucky]].  She joined a student branch of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] while a student at [[Indiana University]]. She earned a degree in English Literature from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Post, Suzy. Interview by Betsy Brinson. January 6, 1999. Catalog no. 20 B 1. &quot;Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky Oral History Project,&quot; Kentucky Historical Society, Frankfort, Ky.  Accessed 16 September 2010. [http://205.204.134.47/civil_rights_mvt/util.aspx?p=1&amp;pid=14969]&lt;/ref&gt; and returned to Kentucky in her late 20s to live near her extended family in Louisville.

==Civil rights leadership==

Ms. Post has been a social justice advocate since the 1950s when the [[Civil Rights Movement]] was first organized in Louisville.  [[Sit-in]]s at segregated businesses were followed by the [[fair housing|open housing]] movement which challenged the cultural norms in real estate transactions that kept homeowners separated by race and religion.
 
In 1969 Post became President of the Kentucky Civil Liberties Union (later the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Kentucky).&lt;ref&gt;Kentucky chapter of the ACLU formed in 1955 (formerly known as the KCLU) to defend the free speech rights of civil rights activists and those protesting the Cold War arms race and war, &quot;Our History&quot; American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky. [http://aclu-ky.org/content/view/51/108 http://aclu-ky.org/content/view/51/108]. Accessed September 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The KCLU provided legal representation for those arrested at many open housing marches, and Post worked with others to raise bail before an open housing law was finally adopted.  
 
While President of the KCLU, Post organized the first statewide women's conference and served as chair of the Kentucky Pro-[[Equal Rights Amendment]] Alliance. Representatives came from a cross section of Louisville's social justice community, and Mayor [[Harvey I. Sloane]] afterwards provided the [http://www.louisvilleky.gov/HumanRelations Louisville-Jefferson County Human Relations Commission] with funds to hire staff to monitor discrimination against women.  Post worked for the local Commission for eight years.  By 1972 the KCLU and the [http://kchr.ky.gov Kentucky Commission on Human Rights] both filed a school [[desegregation]] lawsuit against the Louisville-Jefferson County Board of Education which led finally to the development of a controversial [[busing]] plan in 1975.  As the mother of five children in public schools at that time, Post was seen by the group advised by Robert Sedler (KCLU's volunteer general counsel and tenured law professor at the [[University of Kentucky]]) to be the best candidate to serve as the plaintiff. By 1975 the court-ordered desegregation policy for the Jefferson County Public School system was one of the first in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Haycraft v. Board of Education of Louisville, No. 7291, Memorandum Opinion and Judgment (W.D. Ky. Mar. 8, 1973), rev'd, 489 F.2d 925 (6th Cir. 1973) &amp; 521 F.2d 578 (6th Cir. 1975).  The controversy surrounding race-based decisions in placing students in Louisville's public schools continued in 2000 when the desegregation policy was overturned then challenged by five African-American students, leading to the 2007 U.S. Supreme Court decision in [[Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education]] which ruled unconstitutional the use of race in determining assignment of students in Louisville's public school system.&lt;/ref&gt;  Post also monitored the educational institutions' compliance with [[Title IX]] prohibiting sex discrimination in education.&lt;ref&gt;Fosl, Catherine, and K'Meyer, Tracy E. [http://www.kentuckypress.com/live/title_detail.php?titleid=2180 Freedom on the Border: An Oral History of the Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky]. Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  When she was elected to the National [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) Board of Directors, she organized a women's caucus to improve the status of women on the national board, and directed the strategy planning in 1972 whereby the National ACLU made women's rights its top priority.

As part of the 1960s and 1970s [[anti-war]] movement in Louisville, made famous by the nation's best-known dissident [[Muhammed Ali]], Suzy Post mentored and sheltered soldiers going [[AWOL]], [[Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|draft protesters]] and other youth who opposed the war in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst, John, and Baldwin, Yvonne. &quot;The Not So Silent Minority: Louisville's Antiwar Movement, 1966-1975,&quot; ''Journal of Southern History'' 73 (February 2007): 105-142.&lt;br /&gt;

As the chair of the KCLU she worked to protect the rights of the protesters, but also at times, along with other radicals like Anne and Carl Braden, broke the law personally by hiding soldiers fleeing from nearby Fort Knox.  Providing space for meetings and access to printing machines, the Bradens and Post served as a sort of Underground Railroad for Kentuckians seeking to avoid military service in Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Suzy. Interview by Tracy E. K'Meyer. April 3, 2000. Civil Rights Movement in Kentucky Oral History Project, [[Kentucky Historical Society]], Frankfort, Ky.&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the Human Relations Commission in 1982, Post became the Director of KCLU.  She stayed there until 1990 when she accepted a job as founding Director of the [http://www.metropolitanhousing.org Metropolitan Housing Coalition] (MHC) where she organized a Fair Housing Committee to monitor local compliance with [[fair housing]] law.&lt;ref&gt;Post, Suzy. &quot;Community Monitoring and Title IX: The Why and How of a Title IX Monitoring Project,&quot; ''Integrated Education'' 16 (May-Jun 1978): 40-43.&lt;/ref&gt;  She resigned from MHC in 2006, and remains its Director Emeritus.  She has received numerous awards from many state and local organizations, including the [http://kchr.ky.gov/hof/halloffame2007.htm?&amp;pageOrder=0&amp;selectedPic=10 Kentucky Commission on Human Rights Hall of Fame 2007].

'''Isabella Geriatric Center''' is a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], [[non-sectarian]] organization that has provided residential and community-based services for elderly residents of [[New York City]] since 1875.  The main campus is located in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] at 515 [[Audubon Avenue]] at the corner of 190th Street.

== History ==
[[File:Isabella Uhl.jpg|thumb|left|187px|Isabella Uhl 1846 - 1873]]

When [[Anna Ottendorfer|Anna and Oswald Ottendorfer]] opened the first home in 1875, they named it in honor of Anna's daughter, Isabella Uhl, whose early death at the age of 27 cut short her career in caring for the poor. Isabella had been impressed by the precarious position of aged women without home or family.  When confined to bed, Isabella expressed to her mother the wish that she establish an institution to ensure these women refuge and protection. Two years after Isabella's death, Anna Ottendorfer opened '''Isabella Heimath''' in [[Astoria, Queens]].  The home was originally dedicated to the care of [[indigent]] elderly women, per Isabella Uhl's wishes. Isabella Home moved to its present location in 1889 and simultaneously expanded its mission to care for both women and men, without regard to race, creed or nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Die Isabella Heimath|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A02EEDF133DE433A25753C1A9659C94649ED7CF|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 10, 1895}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Renner|first=J.|title=Isabella Geriatric Center|url=http://www.washington-heights.us/history/archives/isabella_geriatric_center_97.html|publisher=Washington Heights &amp; Inwood Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899, the United States Commission to the Paris exposition of 1900 requested that Isabella Heimath provide photographs for an exhibition on American Charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Great Triumph for America|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E06E7D91039E733A25751C0A96F9C946197D6CF|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 September 1900}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this submission, the home was awarded the Silver Medal for excellence of its building, services and purposes.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

After 76 years Isabella outgrew its capacity of 132 residents and the Board of Managers moved to make provisions for more space and expanded services.  On December 7, 1965, [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]], then [[Governor of New York State]], dedicated '''Isabella House''', a 17-story building containing 12 floors of furnished apartments, three floors of nursing care and two floors for services and public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|work=Isabella Geriatric Center |year=1975 |title=Isabella Geriatric Center 100th Anniversary Commemorative Book |location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The House provided independent living for approximately 250 aged residents.  This affordable housing residence for the well elderly was a new concept in institutional care for the aged.  At the time, it was the first housing program for the elderly which offered medical and nursing care and a package of social services in a setting where personal freedom and independence was assured.

The growth from 132 to approximately 500 residents made it apparent that the original Isabella Home needed to be replaced.  Consequently on April 3, 1972, the 14-story Isabella Nursing Home building was opened.  The combination of facility and program expansion in the next few decades helped to create the present day Isabella Geriatric Center. The 1990s once again called for changes and new goals;  Isabella began a move to create a more home-like ambiance for residents.

== Current work==
Today, Isabella is a large complex offering a diversity of services. In addition to a 705-bed [[nursing home]], Isabella offers independent senior housing, [[Adult daycare center|adult day health care]], child day care, [[home care]], short- and long-term rehabilitation and a variety of community programs designed to help older adults remain healthy while living at home.

Other community-based programs include:

* [[Naturally occurring retirement community|Naturally Occurring Retirement Community (NORC) Programs]]
* Senior Resource Center &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoffman|first=Jan|title=Doggedly Persistent, Untying Medicare Knots for the Elderly|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/18/health/18tren.html|accessdate=1 June 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=18 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Person centered care model ===
The Isabella Geriatric Center and Cobble Hill Health Center have been engaged in an ongoing collaboration to explore new ways to enhance person centered care and to construct a model that uses [[performance improvement]] approaches to guide staff in addressing t  he needs and preferences of residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Isabella Geriatric Center|url=http://www.isabella.org|publisher=Isabella Geriatric Center|accessdate=July 1, 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cobble Hill Health Center|url=http://www.cobblehill.org|publisher=Cobble Hill Health Center|accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Creating Homes and Building Communities|url=http://www.ideasinstitute.org/comintiative.asp|publisher=Ideas Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They have published a manual on culture change and person-centered care for nursing home staffs, &quot;Getting Better All the Time&quot;, which provides practical guidance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&quot;Getting Better All The Time&quot; A Guide for Nursing Home Staff|url=http://www.isabella.org/Isabella/News/Article.aspx?id=cff0ab07-d3b1-4645-a81f-953b1d80337f|publisher=Isabella Geriatric Center and Cobble Hill Health Center|accessdate=10/4/11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Delete''' pro tem. &quot;She is most known for her starring role in Hobo With a Shotgun where she plays &quot;Abby&quot; along side Rutger Hauer&quot;. If/when this film comes out, yes she will probably fit the standards. If she's best known for something not yet finished, let alone released, she fairly obviously doesn't. The film is referenced - none of her other stuff is, and it doesn't look of great note. This is not belittling Molly - she's young and at the start of a career. Many of the greats started in parts they'd not have wanted to remember - or rather other people to remember. Time for the article is when the press outside the town where filming took place take note and start discussing it. I'll expect the article to come back then, and given good sources per [[WP:RS]], we'll welcome it. (Please don't suggest keeping it until then - see [[WP:CRYSTAL]] as anything might happen. If references are produced to show her previous parts were indeed notable, that's a different kettle of fish.) [[User:Peridon|Peridon]] ([[User talk:Peridon|talk]]) 20:28, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

``chrisjames14``
She &quot;will&quot; be most well known for Hobo With a Shotgun, globally, when it comes out, yes. Currently she is already well known in Atlantic Canada, specifically, as one of the strongest young female actors, and certainly the most well known. I'm not sure how many people in any given area, need to think she is notable, to be &quot;notable enough&quot; for Wikipedia's standards. In Atlantic Canada, she is certainly notable enough - is Atlantic Canada too small of an area? If it is required that she is known in a larger area; nationally (Canada), or internationally (Canada&amp;USA), then yes, I agree that this article only be put up &quot;after&quot; Hobo With a Shotgun is released. If Atlantic Canada IS a large enough area for one to be notable and famous in, than I still disagree with the proposed deletion of this page, and '''suggest that it be kept'''.

She is notable is Atlantic Canada for a number of reasons - reasons that could be discussed and written about on her wiki page, however there currently aren't enough already published web sources to provide references for these facts. That is why all that is currently on her wiki page, is surrounding her work in Hobo With a Shotgun - not because this is all she is &quot;known&quot; for in Atlantic Canada, but because this is all that other media have actually written about.

*'''Comment''' I've emboldened Chris's !vote above, and would recommend signing posts with four ~ things. Chris, have a look at those policies. It's not numbers of people - it's coverage to a large extent. If you can show that Molly - not just the film but her herself in person - has been covered by the press on a more than local basis, then please add refs and tell us. We're not anti-Molly. Schmidt above is notorious for spoiling people's fun at AfD by wading in and rescuing sinking articles. If he says 'too soon', you can bet he's been searching. You might have something up your sleeve - if you do (and it's not just your arm...) let us know. &quot;there currently aren't enough already published web sources to provide references for these facts.&quot; - doesn't have to be web (although that's easier to check). Newspapers and magazines (bit too soon perhaps for books) also count. Otherwise, we'll welcome her when they are available (and you might find the article already there).

'''''Kicking a Dead Horse''''' (2007) is an American play written by [[Sam Shepard]]. It is an example of a [[dramatic monologue]] for one man for most of the play, until a woman shows up, in all lasting approximately 80 minutes.

==Plot summary==

Hobart Struther's voyage is interrupted by the death of his horse in a desert. Out of frustration, he kicks it. He stands trying to figure out what to do. Struther made millions by buying cheap paintings and reselling them. In a midlife crisis, he has abandoned his wife and rich life for a trip to understand himself. The former art dealer laments his condition. He must bury the horse. This proves to be very difficult. Next he debates different facets of his personality and life, looking as he mentions several times for authenticity, until every angle seems doomed to failure.

==Performance history==

''Kicking a Dead Horse'' premiered at the [[Abbey Theatre]] of [[Dublin]] in 2007, starring the Irish actor [[Stephen Rea]], and then with the same actor at New York's [[The Public Theater]] and the [[Almeida Theatre]] in London in 2008.

The New York production was directed by Sam Shepard, with sets by Brien Vahey costumes by Joan Bergin, lighting by John Comiskey, sound by [[Dan Moses Schreier]]; the production stage manager was Barbara Reo, general manager, Nicki Genovese, associate artistic director, Mandy Hackett, associate producer, Jenny Gersten, director of production, Ruth E. Sternberg, presented by the Public Theater, Oskar Eustis, artistic director,

==Publications==
''Kicking a Dead Horse'' is published by Vintage Books, 2008, ISBN 0-307-38682-1, ISBN 978-0-307-38682-3

Synopsis, Rea and Shepard comments of the play, selected reviews, and publicity photos are found at http://www.sam-shepard.com/deadhorse.html

The Almeida Theatre production details are found at http://www.almeida.co.uk/production_details/production_details.aspx?code=70

The [[New York Times]] theatre review is found at http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/07/15/theater/reviews/15kick.html pointing out that the bleak landscape is reminiscent of the [[Theatre of the Absurd]], particularly [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Waiting for Godot]] and [[Happy Days (play)]]. The first images of the Shepard play are said to be striking, but there is little development.

'''Garrett Island''' is an island located in [[Cecil County, Maryland|Cecil County]], [[Maryland]], {{convert|1.8|mi|km}} from the mouth of the [[Susquehanna River]], directly west of [[Perryville, Maryland|Perryville]] and north of [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite gnis |id=584559 |name=Garrett Island |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] as part of the [[Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CBJournal2009June&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bayjournal.com/article.cfm?article=3605 |first=Lara |last=Lutz |title=Steps Being Taken to Allow Public to Set Foot on Island |work=Chesapeake Bay Journal |date=June 2009 |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The island is crossed by the [[CSX Susquehanna River Bridge]] on the north side and the [[Thomas J. Hatem Memorial Bridge]] on the south side.

==Geography==
The ''Cecil Observer'', quoting the ''Chesapeake Bay Journal'', describes the geologic history of Garrett Island: &quot;'Garrett Island is the geologic remnant of what was once an offshore volcano in an ancient sea. The rocky high ground on the island's west side is the remains of the volcanic core. Basalt and quartz formed by the volcanic activity are still present.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CecilObserver20100501&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cecilobserver.com/?p=1262 |title=Cecil's Sleeping Volcano |work=Cecil Observer |date=May 1, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garrett Island is the only rocky island in the tidal waters of the [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CongRecH4597&quot;&gt;{{USCongRec|2002|H4597|date=July 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Human presence on Garrett Island is known from 8,000 to 5,000 years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBJournal2009June&quot; /&gt; [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]] may have visited the island in 1608 but there is no definitive documentation proving this.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBJournal2009June&quot; /&gt; In 1622, the island was given to Edward Palmer as part of a [[land grant]] by [[James I of England|King James I]], and the earliest documented European presence dates to 1637 when [[William Claiborne]] established a [[trading post]] on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBJournal2009June&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aegis20100505&quot; /&gt; In the same year, Maryland troops evicted Claiborne's [[Virginia]] traders from the Upper Chesapeake region and built Fort Conquest on what was then called &quot;Palmer's Island.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.northamericanforts.com/East/md.html |first=Pete |last=Payette |title=American Forts East: Maryland |work=North American Forts, 1526–1956 |date=August 30, 2010 |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the later [[Thirteen Colonies|colonial period]], the island was farmed by a family named &quot;Watson&quot; and it eventually came to be called &quot;Watson Island.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aegis20100505&quot; /&gt;

Watson Island was purchased by the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&amp;O) in the 1880s so [[CSX Susquehanna River Bridge|a bridge]] could be built across the Susquehanna River at that point. The island was named after [[John W. Garrett]], then president of the railroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aegis20100505&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.exploreharford.com/news/4461/tale-two-islands-geography-limits-garretts-growth/ |first=Jim |last=Kennedy |title=A Tale of Two Islands: Geography Limits Garrett's Growth |newspaper=The Aegis |publisher=exploreharford.com |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wildlife==
Garrett Island provides habitat for 44 species of birds including [[eagle]]s, [[Great Northern Loon|common loons]], [[Tundra Swan|tundra swans]], and 14 species of ducks.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongRecH4597&quot; /&gt;

'''NC 112''' is an east-west [[state highway]] in western [[North Carolina]] in [[Buncombe County, NC|Buncombe County]], southwest of [[Asheville, NC|Asheville]].
==Route description==
North Carolina Highway 112 begins its western end at [[U.S. Route 19 in North Carolina|US 19]]/[[U.S. Route 23 in North Carolina|US 23]] (Smokey Park Highway) in the [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] community of [[Enka, North Carolina|Enka]].&lt;ref name=NCR/&gt;&lt;ref name=yahoo/&gt; From here it travels south and then east on Sand Hill Road before turning southeasterly on Sardis Road for a distance before ending at [[North Carolina Highway 191]] (Brevard Road).&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo&quot;&gt;{{cite map|publisher=[[Yahoo Maps]]|url=http://maps.yahoo.com/#mvt=m&amp;lat=35.538712&amp;lon=-82.612423&amp;zoom=14&amp;q1=35.545556%2C-82.658814&amp;q2=35.526419%2C-82.606801|title=Overview Map North Carolina Route 112|accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The NC 112 designation first appeared in 1930 as a new routing, running from US 19/NC 10 (present-day now [[U.S. Route 74 in North Carolina|US 74]]/[[U.S. Route 441 in North Carolina|US 441]]) near [[Wilmont, North Carolina|Wilmont]] to NC 107 (present-day [[U.S. Route 19 in North Carolina|US 19]]) at [[Cherokee, North Carolina|Cherokee]].&lt;ref name=NCR/&gt; Around 1938, this routing was re-designated as North Carolina Highway 107-E, onto which present-day US 441 and US 441 Business run.&lt;ref name=NCR/&gt; 

In 1940, Highway 112 reappeared as a new primary routing, running from US 19/US 23 at [[Candler, North Carolina|Candler]] southwest to the Buncombe-Henderson County Line.&lt;ref name=NCR/&gt; During the early 1950s, NC 112 was extended east along US 19/US 23 via an overlap and then southeasterly to NC 191. Around 1963, the original western segment between Candler and the county line was renumbered as NC 151, leaving only the present day routing between Enka and Venable.

I am nominating this for featured article because we believe have been able to successfully recreate the high level of prose and information as seen before in other related articles to this one such as [[Pedro II of Brazil]] and [[Honório Carneiro Leão, Marquis of Paraná]]. All three are closely linked to each other and together are a great source to understand the 58-year long reign of the second Emperor of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. The readers who enjoyed our previous articles will certainly enjoy this one too. Regards to all.  [[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 19:26, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

::More directly, Fasach's objection is ludicrous. Nowhere in the [[Wikipedia:Categories, lists, and navigation templates|relevant guideline]] does it say anything about templates requiring sources.

:::I am astonished with Fasach Nua's participation in this FAC nomination. He did not even bother to read the article itself, which is what does matter. Could you imagine someone opposing a very good article about [[Maximilian of Mexico]], for example, only because it has a template with the name of the most well known monarchs in the Americas (Brazil, Canada, Inca, Aztec, etc..), but not all? You don't like the template, you don't like a category, or something similar, go complain there, not in an article which has nothing to with. What kind of behavior is that? How can someone like him be able to vote in here?

: Personal opinion, unrelated to WIAFA; I don't find it helpful to completely disregard Fasach Nua's (or many FA reviewers') point.  What is the inclusion criterion for that template?  If you're using something in a Featured article, you should consider such matters and be able to answer the query, just as good practice and an indication that you've thought about it. I worked up the template {{t1|Tourette syndrome}} for [[Tourette syndrome]], and I can clearly explain the inclusion criterion for each entity; if you can't, that could be an indication of a problem.  For example, I can't have just anyone adding people to the template with TS; they have to be notable and referenced to sources that meet [[WP:MEDRS]], and that is the case for every person linked.

* '''Comment''' - The map is wrong. It uses the national limits arranged after the War of the Triple Alliance. And it may be misleading: as far as I know, there were no Bolivian soldiers in Urquiza's army, but the map and caption may suggest so. [[User:MBelgrano|MBelgrano]] ([[User talk:MBelgrano|talk]]) 11:23, 24 November 2010 (UTC)
:I changed the caption. The map is not supposed to be a faithful reproduction of the limits as they were in 1852, or I believe what you mean, of the contested limits between those countries. It is just a map to allow readers to understand where the war occurred. Just that. I crossed with many editors who were not capable of understanding that Paraguay and Uruguay were different countries or where Argentina was located. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 12:08, 24 November 2010 (UTC)

* &lt;s&gt;'''Oppose''' at this stage.&lt;/s&gt;'''Weakly support'''
* I'm happy with the scholarship and the research. One minor gap I'd note, though, is that I didn't quite understand what the two bishops were imprisoned for in the &quot;Quarrel of the Bishops&quot; - was it a &quot;trumped up&quot; charge against them, or were they simply prosecuted for their actions against the Freemasons?
* My major concern at this point is the quality of the prose. It is functional, but often not FAR in my opinion. The prose in various places isn't wrong, so much as slightly awkward. Prose quality is, inevitably, slightly subjective, and so I've given some examples below to illustrate my worries:
:*&quot;Their diplomatic objective to forge alliances was successfully concluded&quot;. The previous sentence established their diplomatic role, and I think the construction is awkward. This could simply read &quot;They were successful in forging new alliances&quot;, for example.
:*&quot;Many decades later, José recalled the Bahia of his early life as &quot;my native land, to which I have always dedicated much love&quot;&quot; The construction's a bit odd. How about simply &quot;Many decades later, Jose described Bahia as &quot;my native land, to which I have always dedicated much love.&quot;?
:*&quot;His articles in liberal newspapers attracted the attention...&quot; Beginning a new section with a pronoun isn't ideal; I'd recommend putting his name in here and going for the pronoun in the second sentence.
:*&quot;sometimes considered a sect of the Liberal Party&quot; Do you really mean sect? I'd not normally associate the word with an element of a political party. &quot;faction&quot;, perhaps? Or &quot;sometimes considered a front for the Liberal Party&quot;?
:*&quot;and became more politically savvy&quot; - is there a better word than &quot;savvy&quot;? &quot;experienced&quot;?
:*&quot;The Liberal Party did not easily accept its loss of power&quot; - the &quot;easily&quot; feels archaic. &quot;The Liberal Party was not content to lose its grip on power&quot;, perhaps?
:*&quot;The group was unable to convince the vast majority of the population of any benefits to revolt&quot; - again, the construction feels awkward. &quot;The group was unable to convince the vast majority of the population to revolt.&quot;? &quot;Few amongst the population were prepared to revolt in support of the ''praieiros''&quot;?
:*&quot;However, all of these—including the Law of Free Birth—contained flaws which hampered their full effectiveness.&quot; Again, its the construction of the sentence. &quot;All of these reforms, including the Law of Free Birth, contained crucial flaws&quot;, perhaps? 
*There's some more examples later on, but it is this sort of issue that's worrying me. Happy to help further, as I like the underlying research and narrative. [[User:Hchc2009|Hchc2009]] ([[User talk:Hchc2009|talk]]) 23:07, 24 November 2010 (UTC)
::'''Reply''': All of the sentences you flagged as awkward have been reworded by editors. Regarding the arrest of the bishops, Brazil had been granted great control over the Brazilian Church by the pope (see the &quot;Quarrel with bishops&quot; section). They were essentially employees of the state and their refusal to adopt the government's position was seen as insubordination. I've tweaked the sentence to indicate that reason.

*:&quot;Brazil's Conservative Cabinet decided to form military alliances with neighboring countries threatened by the dictator.&quot; - neighbouring to Brazil, or neighbouring to Argentina? (or both?)
:::I will answer only the ones dedicated to the subject, leaving prose, spelling, grammar and similar to Astynax, who is far more capable than I to deal with that. To both.

*:&quot;Paranhos's writings began to support Brazil's proactive foreign policy,&quot;. I'm wandering if a more natural construction would be &quot;Paranhos began to write articles in support of Brazil's...&quot; or &quot;Paranho began to support Brazil's...&quot;?
*:&quot;Carneiro Leão departed for Montevideo, the Uruguayan capital.

I don't know what the original Portuguese is, but I'd suggest/guess that a more natural English translation might be: &quot;I did not consult anyone before naming you. What influenced my decision was that I could appreciate your merits. I hope you will prove that I was right.&quot;

::My sources are no explicit to when exactly they died. They only say that Paranhos` parents died when he was a child, with his mother dying just a few years after his father.

His mother died a few years after that, probably when he was around 8 or 9.

*&lt;s&gt;At the end of the &quot;Early years&quot; section you say he became a journalist in 1848, but then the next section says that he was elected in 1845 with the patronage of Aureliano Coutinho, whose attention he had attracted with his articles.  Presumably these articles were written when he was a journalist, so something is wrong with the dates here.  Or did he start writing articles before he actually considered himself a journalist?&lt;/s&gt;
::My mistake, he began his career as a journalist around 1844.

*&lt;s&gt;I think a little more explanation might be in order for the period around 1847.  The Courtier Faction is excluded from power, during the period when there are four consecutive cabinets all made up of Liberals.  At this point I assumed that the Courtiers were excluded after 1847, since they are only sometimes considered to be a sect of Liberals.  But then when the Conservatives take power in 1848, Paranhos loses his influence.  How did he have influence if he wasn't in the cabinet? Hadn't the Courtier Faction lost power in 1847?&lt;/s&gt;
::The courtiers were high ranking palace servants, as well as powerful politicians. They are considered by some historians as a faction inside the Liberal Party, itself a loose coalition of groups that had little in common with each other. Around 1847 Pedro II dismissed Aureliano Coutinho - the leader of the politicians who were part of the Courtier Faction - from the office of president (governor) or Rio de Janeiro. He also sent to Russia as an ambassador for many years Paulo Barbosa, steward and leader of the servants who worked in the Imperial Palace. Meanwhile, since 1844 the Liberal Party governed the country, but was uncapable of keeping any cabinet for more than a year. Without Aureliano Coutinho and Paulo Barbosa, the two men who influenced Pedro II and helped them remain in power, the Liberals were doomed. Pedro II grew tired of their incompetence and flawed government and once the last cabinet resigned in 1848 due to a vote of no confidence from the parliament, he called upon the Conservative Party to form a new cabinet.
:::That's helpful.  I went back and reread this section and I think I just wasn't reading it carefully; the information is there.  It's just complicated. I'm striking this comment; I don't think there's a need to change anything. [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] [[User_talk:Mike Christie|(talk)]] 13:39, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;&quot;this would be complicated by the events that quickly followed&quot;: what does &quot;this&quot; refer to?  Paranhos' loss of influence?  That doesn't seem to be the sort of thing that can be complicated.  Do you mean &quot;the situation would be complicated&quot;? Even then I think it's a bit vague.  Certainly his position is made more difficult by subsequent events; how about &quot;his position would be complicated&quot;?&lt;/s&gt;
::Indeed you should reformulate &quot;''With his party no longer in control, Paranhos lost much of his influence, and this would be complicated by the events that quickly followed.''&quot; Aureliano Coutinho did simply disappear, he was still a senator, but that meant little after Pedro II removed him from the office of governor. He lost all influence and power he once had. That meant that whatever power Paranhos had by then, it was all lost without his benefactor`s aid. The events mentioned is the Praieira revolt that destroyed the remaining reputation that the Liberal Party had. In my opinion, you shold simply remove the complete sentence. The text will flow better without it.

*&lt;s&gt;&quot;Brazil's territorial integrity was threatened as well as the reestablishment of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata&quot;: a reader unfamiliar with South American history is unlikely to know what is intended here; I looked it up and I think the intention is to say that the possible reestabishment of a regional hegemony such as the Viceroyalty had been was regarded as a threat, and that de Rosas's polices were the cause of that threat.  How about &quot;The Argentine dictator also had ambitions to conquer Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, and his planned reestablishment of the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, a regional empire containing  much of Brazil's territory, threatened Brazil's territorial integrity.&quot;  That's assuming he did explicitly plan to reestablish it and was not merely building an empire by whatever land he could grab.  Even if that's not right, the sentence doesn't work as it stands.&lt;/s&gt;

What he wanted was to reunite all lands that were once part of the viceroyalty into one large and powerful republic where he would rule as a dictator. Unlike Brazil, that remained as one piece, the Hispanic colonies broke into themselves into several different nations. Be careful not to put &quot;containing  much of Brazil's territory&quot;. He was after the southern province of Rio Grande do Sul, which is a very small part of the Brazilian territory.
:::So the reference to the Viceroyalty is simply shorthand to indicate the territory Rosas was trying to acquire (apart from Rio Grande do Sul, which hadn't been part of it)?  If so, I think it could be dropped completely, since it hasn't been mentioned before and will not be helpful to readers unfamiliar with the topic.  In that case, could we change it to &quot;Don Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of Argentina, had assisted the Tatters separatist rebels in the Brazilian province of Rio Grande do Sul during the 1830s, and continued to attempt its annexation.  In addition to the threat to Brazil's territorial integrity, Rosas had ambitions to conquer Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia&quot;?  If it's important to mention the Viceroyalty, perhaps because it was an important referent in the diplomacy of the time, we could make it&quot;Paraguay, Uruguay and Bolivia, reestablishing the territory of the former Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata under his own rule.&quot;  Would that work? [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] [[User_talk:Mike Christie|(talk)]] 14:31, 26 November 2010 (UTC)
::::I think you should simply remove all references to the viceroyalty. As you said yourself, for a reader who knows nothing about Hispanic-American history, mentioning the viceroyalty will only make everything harder to understand, which is unnecessary. Simply saying that Rosas wanted to annex those countries to form a powerful nation under his dictatorial rule will be enough. Brazil was then like the Byzantine Empire: the government used its excelent diplomatic corps to throw the Hispanic republics against each other, making them weaker. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 15:38, 26 November 2010 (UTC)
:::::Done. [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] [[User_talk:Mike Christie|(talk)]] 16:28, 26 November 2010 (UTC)
*&lt;s&gt;The first paragraph of the section on the war of the Triple Alliance contains essentially no information about the war between 1864 and 1869, just this: &quot;The Paraguayan invasion in 1864 led to a conflict far longer than expected&quot;. I think a little more is needed -- at least a sentence saying that Paraguay invaded Argentina and Brazil at the end of 1864 and early 1865, and that Brazil liberated its provinces in 1867 -- and so forth.&lt;/s&gt;

::I do not agree with you on this one. I did not mention the military operations regarding the Praieira rebellion, nor the Platine War, nor the Uruguayan War and so on. If I expanded the text to explain what happened in those wars as you are suggesting, the text would lose its focus and become too large. The interest in here is to explain the war from the foreign diplomacy view, which was what Paranhos was involved with.
:::I've struck the objection; rereading that section I think there is enough context.  You're right that the article shouldn't cover military operations, but the reader has to know a little about the war if it is relevant to Paranhos.  I think there's enough there. [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] [[User_talk:Mike Christie|(talk)]] 14:31, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;Reading the article on the [[War of the Triple Alliance]] makes me wonder about your characterization of the years after the war as a golden age.  That article says that the debt incurred during the war was crippling, and even refers to a &quot;depression&quot;.  Is that inaccurate?  If not, shouldn't it be reflected in the discussion of the aftermath in Paranhos's article?&lt;/s&gt;
::The War of the Triple Alliance article is wrong and unsourced, not counting that is a very messy text. I recommend [[Pedro II of Brazil#Conclusion of hostilities]] and [[Pedro II of Brazil in the War of the Triple Alliance#Victory]]. Also, not included on those articles is the testimony of a Brazilian P.O.W. who fought in the war, the later General E. A. da Cunha Matos: &quot;When the fight ended, Brazil had its finances so relieved, that it raised the salary of the military, of the civilian public servants and undertook great material enterprises.&quot; '''Source''': Versen, Max Von.

:::OK, striking this one. [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] [[User_talk:Mike Christie|(talk)]] 14:36, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;&quot;Only one would later achieve notoriety&quot;: do you really mean &quot;notoriety&quot;, or should this be something like &quot;would later go on to political prominence&quot;?&lt;/s&gt;
::Yes. All the other ministers were minor politicians. Only Joao Alfredo would later become not only a notorious politician, but one of the leader of the Conservative Party. And most important of all, he was the prime minister when the law that abolished slavery completely was passed.
:::&quot;Notorious&quot; implies that he was unfavourably regarded, though; is that really what you mean?  Was he widely disliked?  Or should it be &quot;famous&quot; or &quot;prominent&quot;? [[User:Mike Christie|Mike Christie]] [[User_talk:Mike Christie|(talk)]] 14:36, 26 November 2010 (UTC)
::::Prominent is better. He went to become one of the most respected politicians in the end of the Empire. After the monarchy was ended by the republican coup, he left national politics forever, which is often lamented by historians. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 15:38, 26 November 2010 (UTC)

*&lt;s&gt;&quot;In an attempt at rectification&quot;: if I understand the intended meaning here, I think &quot;reform&quot; would be a better word than &quot;rectification&quot;.&lt;/s&gt;
*:Well, no; you use &quot;reform&quot; later in that sentence.  How about &quot;In an attempt to improve the quality of the clergy&quot;?
::Yes, it could be. The government spend years improving the quality of the clergy, sinc the elder generations lacked the qualities necessary. --[[User:Lecen|Lecen]] ([[User talk:Lecen|talk]]) 23:10, 25 November 2010 (UTC)

*'''Image review'''. Thanks to the very reasonable copyright laws of Brazil I was able to determine that all of the historical images in the article are public domain. The only one I was not able to determine absolutely was [[:File:Conde d Eu visconde do rio branco 1870.jpg]], a photograph taken in 1870 by Carlos César. I was not able to find a death date for Carlos César, but he would have had to have lived for 70 years after taking the photo (2010 - 70 - 1870 = 70) for it to possibly still be copyrighted. I think it is quite reasonable to assume it has public domain status. If anyone can find a death date for him, please add it to the image description page. Also, I would suggest removing the border from [[:File:Visconde_do_Rio_Branco_1879.jpg]]. [[User:Kaldari|Kaldari]] ([[User talk:Kaldari|talk]]) 21:07, 25 November 2010 (UTC)
::&quot;Almost nothing is known about Carlos César, author of the photographs reproduced in here on the Paraguayan War [a.k.a. War of the Triple Alliance], except for the fact that he was the owner of Universal Gallery, located in the ''gaúcha'' city of Humaitá. The photographs were taken from a small album dedicated to the viscount of Rio Branco and belongs to the collection of the National Historical Museum.

::As you can see, he was already active in 1868 and before the war (that begun in 1864) he owned a photograph workshop, which means that he was an already experienced photographer. I can hardlybelieve that a man... lets say around his 30s in 1864 could have survived until 1940, that is, 76 years later, in a time where the most fortunate ones could expect to live until the 60s at most.

*'''Support''' - the article does seem to meet all the criteria. I do have a couple of points to raise, though:
**Of the 9 endnotes, 4 are uncited. Is this a problem?
**Did you consider using [http://books.google.com/books?id=RYyAx6Di_2gC&amp;pg=PA226 this] [http://books.google.com/books?id=RYyAx6Di_2gC&amp;q=Paranhos#v=snippet&amp;q=Paranhos&amp;f=false source], or is it superfluous?

::Superfluous, since everything it says (Paranhos' eraly career as a liberal and journalist, the surprise of his choice as Carneiro Leão's aid in 1851 and Pedro II's role in breaking apart the Conservative Party in 1872) is already mentioned in the text.

*'''Comment''' - the article is well-written and informative; I particularly like the legacy section.

::'''Replies''' and further explanation:
::*ISBN: not all older and non-English works are assigned ISBNs. Lecen can double-check that, however.
::*As stated in a previous answer to the question as to when his father died, the sources do not give a date.
::*He decided to return to teaching and journalism after the fall of the Liberals. There is not an exact date given in the sources of which I am aware.
::*The sources do not give a starting date at which point the Courtier Faction began dominating Brazil's government. They acquired power and began acting in concert over a period of time.
::*The year 1844 you mention occurs in the range of dates: &quot;From February 1844 through May 1848&quot;. It isn't really jumping back in the narrative, but rather just describing the period during which the Liberal Party was in control.
::*The sentence from Paranhos is giving his reason for refusing. I have made a change to make it clear that it is Paranhos who is writing.

:::Replies:
:::*'''ISBNs:''' Astynax is correct.
:::*'''Father's death:''' unfortunately, the source which used in this article are not clear to when his parents died. All it is said is that his father died when he was learning to read and write (around age 5 or 6) and that his mother followed his father a few years later.
:::*'''When he became a civilian:''' in 1843, just after he graduted in the Military Academy. I'm sorry that I wasn't more clear before. I reworked the text and I hope it is better. Please improve it if any of you believe it has to.
:::*Coutier Faction: the Courtiers began acting as early as 1833. However, they became an all-powerful political faction after Pedro II was declared of age in 1840. Is it necessary to add this?

'''Government risk''' is an [[investment]] term used to collectively describe the impact of prospective changes in legislation, policies of the executive branch within existing legislation, and corruption.  

It is typically referenced as distinct from other forms of risk, such as [[market risk]], [[credit risk]], price risk, and natural risk when assessing the viability of an investment project.

== Distinction from Country Risk ==

It is often confused with the term &quot;[[country risk]]&quot; when assessing investments in foreign countries, but government risk is in fact a subset of country risk.  Specifically, government risk refers only to interactions with government, but not the following elements of country risk:
*  crime and property security
*  currency risk
*  different cultural norms around business ethics
*  monopolies or business conglomerate power within in-country markets

'''Doctor Yusef Khan''' is a [[character (arts)|fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Ace Bhatti]]. Yusef is the father of [[Afia Khan]] ([[Meryl Fernandes]]) and former husband of [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). He appears from 23&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2010. Described as strong-willed, he arrives as [[Walford]]'s new [[general practitioner]]. He departed on 26 December 2011, following the end of his domestic abuse storyline with his wife [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]). Bhatti was voted &quot;Best Newcomer&quot; at the [[TV Quick]] awards and for &quot;Best Storyline&quot; for destroying the Masoods.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
Yusef married [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) in Pakistan at the age of 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sickener&quot; /&gt; Zainab brought shame upon their respective families when she had an affair with [[Masood Ahmed]] ([[Nitin Ganatra]]). As punishment, Yusef set Zainab on fire, though he claimed it to be his family's doing and that he tried to save her. Masood rescued Zainab and she divorced Yusef to marry Masood, moving with him to the UK. Yusef later remarried and had a daughter, [[Afia Khan|Afia]] ([[Meryl Fernandes]]).

===2010–11===
Yusef first appears when Afia introduces him to her boyfriend [[Tamwar Masood]] ([[Himesh Patel]]). Tamwar feels he is not good enough for Afia in Yusef's eyes as he is from a poor background, but Yusef says that does not matter and approves of Tamwar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 23/11/2010 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w5b2n |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Wendy Granditer|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Tamwar mentions his mother Zainab Masood's name, Yusef visits the Masood home and finds the door open. When Zainab sees him, she screams and orders him out. It is revealed they were husband and wife from an arranged marriage when Yusef was 17,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sickener&quot; /&gt; and Yusef's family had poured oil on her and set her on fire. Yusef says it was his family, not him, and he attempted to save her, revealing bad scarring on his body. Tamwar's father Masood Ahmed, Tamwar and Afia return home, and Masood attacks Yusef, punching him twice. After Yusef returns, Tamwar asks Masood to speak to Yusef, and when he visits, he finds out Tamwar and Afia are still seeing each other. He gives his blessing for them to be married.

Yusef becomes the local [[general practitioner]] for Walford and takes an interest in [[Denise Fox]] ([[Diane Parish]]). He is later pickpocketed by [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]). Denise tells Yusef that there have been rumours about him going round, [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) is responsible so he goes and talks to Dot; she ignores him. Zainab tells Yusef that Afia will be welcome to the family but he will not. Yusef reminisces about the past leading to Zainab telling Masood they must stop the wedding. Yusef starts a relationship with Denise.

Yusef encourages Zainab and Masood's estranged son [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliott]]) to take the first step in making amends as he is gay, and Syed goes to Tamwar and Afia's mangni (engagement party). The roof collapses and Syed is hospitalised and Yusef lies to Zainab that Syed could die so she visits him, but his injuries were not serious noticing that Yusef tricked her. Yusef makes out that he is sleeping with Zainab so Masood and [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) then kidnap Yusef in an attempt to scare him away. Masood threatens to pour petrol over Yusef, though it is only water and leaves him unharmed. When Masood returns home, Yusef has cuts on his face and blames it on Masood. Everyone believes Yusef and Masood is rejected from his home. Yusef convinces Tamwar, Afia and Zainab that Masood should not be at the mehndi. At the wedding, Masood turns up to try to stop it but Tamwar reveals that he and Afia already married. Yusef's cousin [[List of EastEnders characters (2011)#Tariq|Tariq]] (Antony Bunsee) arrives and he reveals that Yusef started the fire that burnt Zainab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 23/06/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0122n4b |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Jerry Smith; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Daran Little|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing news that Syed is trying to find his wife [[Amira Shah]] ([[Preeya Kalidas]]), Yusef visits her father, [[Qadim Shah|Qadim]] ([[Ramon Tikaram]]) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great feelings for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself is causing Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the [[Divorce (Islamic)|triple talaq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 26/09/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b015cqks |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: John Greening; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Rob Gittins|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title=Masood decides to divorce Zainab|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a341115/masood-decides-to-divorce-zainab.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yusef learns that Amira gave birth to Syed's daughter [[Yasmin Masood|Yasmin]], so persuades Zainab to take a holiday with him and Kamil in Pakistan. While there, he suggests that they move there permanently as a family. On their return to Walford, Yusef learns that Amira has been seeing Syed, so tells Amira that she is not wanted by the Masood family. Amira ignores him and Zainab meets Yasmin, and informs Yusef that she cannot leave Walford after becoming a grandmother. Yusef then puts doubt into the mind of Syed's boyfriend, [[Christian Clarke]] ([[John Partridge (actor)|John Partridge]]), about Syed's paternity of Yasmin. Christian then asks Yusef to perform a secret [[Parental testing|paternity test]] on Yasmin, however Yusef uses his own [[DNA]] for the test, creating a false result. However, his falsification is exposed, leaving the Masood family hostile towards him, and Zainab devastated. Later, Yusef tells Zainab that he told the lies to protect her. She is sceptical, but when Yusef revives [[Amy Mitchell]] (Natalia and Kamil Lipka-Kozanka) who has almost drowned, Zainab is impressed with Yusef's caring attitude, but says it does not change things.

Amira goes to Yusef for help, saying she needs him on her side, threatening to tell Zainab that Yusef bought her a plane ticket if he does not help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian touched him, and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This turns out to be untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford.

Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab, to the point of becoming violent with her. Yusef then tries to encourage Zainab to move to Pakistan, and recruits Amira to manipulate Syed with the same idea. As Zainab starts to disrespect his wishes, Yusef slaps her and apologises as he thought he was going to lose her. Yusef meets up with Tariq and offers him his daughter's restaurant. Upon discovering that the restaurant doesn't belong to Yusef, he reveals to Afia that Yusef started the fire involving Zainab. Afia then tells Yusef she knows he started the fire and threatens to tell Zainab if he does not do so first. Yusef admits to Zainab that he started the fire and kicks him out of the house, she later forgives Yusef however. Yusef and Zainab then marry.

After Zainab and Jane argue in the street Zainab and Yusef return home. Zainab slaps Yusef after he says Kamil will be an outcast to him but Yusef slaps Zainab back. Yusef then hastily arranges a flight for himself, Zainab and Kamil to Pakistan, but Zainab purposefully discards her passport to prevent the trip. Yusef then kidnaps Kamil, telling Zainab that he is being kept in a safe place and refuses to let Zainab see him. After about four days of not knowing, Yusef takes Zainab to a café in the High Street, where a relative returns Kamil to Zainab. During the visit, it emerges that Yusef told Bushra's family that Zainab had a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]], which is why he needed to have Kamil looked after. When Yusef takes a call outside the café, Zainab tries to escape with Kamil through an emergency exit in the back of the shop. However, Yusef guessed her plan and was waiting for her outside the exit. As she tried to escape, Yusef warned her that he knows everything, and if she leaves him, he will kill Tamwar and Kamil. Masood races to the restaurant and secretly promises that he'll do whatever it takes to get her out of her marriage to Yusef.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 23/12/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018w7nc |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Lee Salisbury; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Daisy Coulham|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zainab finally stands up to Yusef and refuses to leave for Pakistan. Yusef attacks her and after learning that Masood has Kamil, retaliates towards Yusef. Yusef drugs Zainab, and the family return to the house. Masood punches Yusef before calling the police. Afia confronts Yusef and orders him to leave. Yusef is later found by Masood at the bed and breakfast with a match and some petrol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 25/12/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018w9jn |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Michael Owen Morris; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Carey Andrews|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=25 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusef attacks Masood and lights a fire leaving Masood for dead. [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) and Christian put the fire out but the fire is later reignited trapping Masood, Phil and Denise inside. Yusef taunts Zainab outside. Zainab lies and tells him that Afia is in the building and he runs in followed by Tamwar. Masood is later rescued and as Yusef remains upstairs he realises that Afia is in fact outside. Realising Zainab tricked him, he briefly smiles, and the floor collapses beneath him and he succumbs to the flames, killing him.&lt;ref name=&quot;26 December&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 26/12/2011 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018w9mt |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Michael Owen Morris; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Pete Lawson|network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, firefighters retrieve his body. He leaves everything to Zainab in his will.

==Creation and development==

===Casting, introduction and departure===
Bhatti was already known to ''EastEnders'' executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] when he auditioned for the part, as Kirkwood and Bhatti worked on ''[[Coronation Street]]'' at the same time. Bhatti was the only actor who auditioned for the part of Yusef.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitby Gazette&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.whitbygazette.co.uk/news/local/meet_whitby_s_soap_star_doctor_1_3191521|title=Meet Whitby's soap star doctor|date=18 March 2011|work=[[Whitby Gazette]]|accessdate=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Wadia recommended Bhatti to Kirkwood to play Yusef, as she &quot;thought that he definitely had the quality that Yusef would need—which is a very ambiguous but charming quality!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nw&quot;/&gt; Bhatti explained to ''[[Digital Spy]]'' that the ''EastEnders'' cast are very welcoming. He explained: &quot;They're so welcoming. There's a lot of joking about. I'm having a great time at EastEnders - it's a real privilege to be here. I've known Nitin and Nina Wadia, who plays Zainab, for a very long time and we've always got on very well. Nitin and I play tense scenes together so it's nice that we can have a laugh afterwards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rainey|first=Naomi|title=Ace Bhatti: 'Enders cast are so welcoming'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a321334/ace-bhatti-enders-cast-are-so-welcoming.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yusef is introduced as part of a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef is introduced to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood &quot;explodes&quot; with anger at the sight of him,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5h5I4q4hwIiPatLLf09bynNzcmCPQ?docId=N0094471289903181496A|title=Ganatra: It's time Masood got tough|date=16 November 2010|publisher=Press Association|accessdate=16 November 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uI4et0yk|archivedate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: &quot;we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it from his point of view that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is that I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasty&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://holysoap.channel5.com/eastenders/news/nitin-on-dark-side-of-masood-13925|title=Nitin on dark side of Masood|date=5 May 2011|work=[[Holy Soap]]|publisher=[[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]]|accessdate=7 May 2011}}{{Dead link |date=April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a288064/enders-actor-praises-tamwar-love-story.html|title='Enders actor praises Tamwar love story|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=16 November 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=16 November 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March&amp;nbsp;2011, Bhatti said he was staying with ''EastEnders'' until around June 2011, and would &quot;see from there&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitby Gazette&quot;/&gt; He made his first appearance on 23&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;23nov&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 23/11/2010 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00w5b2n |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Lance Kneeshaw; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Wendy Granditer |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganatra spoke at the [[British Soap Awards|British Soap Awards 2011]] to ''[[Digital Spy]]'' and praised the impact of Yusef saying,&quot;He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - for someone to come and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bsa11&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a319782/eastenders-actor-praises-yusef-impact.html|title='EastEnders' actor praises Yusef impact|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=16 May 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=24 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bhatti's departure was not announced. When a fire was reported to be happening around Christmas 2011, rumours emerged from an alleged ''EastEnders'' insider that &quot;Yusef has long been tipped as a possible fatality&quot;. The insider added &quot;This is the biggest fire ''EastEnders'' has ever seen and there will be casualties. It is such a huge disaster that it will affect most of the families on the show in one way or another. There is a great tradition at ''EastEnders'' of captivating Christmas Day storylines and this year is no different.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders': More Christmas fire rumours emerge|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a351401/eastenders-more-christmas-fire-rumours-emerge.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yusef's death aired on 26 December 2011 concluding his storyline.&lt;ref name=&quot;26 December&quot; /&gt;

===Personality===

===Storyline development===
{{Quote_box |width=30% |align=right|quote=&quot;Yusef would die for his daughter - without question, at a moment's notice. I think he's very happy that she's found love with Tamwar - he likes the combination between them and he likes the fact that Tamwar makes his daughter happy.

He said that &quot;it definitely hurts&quot; when he finds out that Tamwar and Afia are already married as he is so close to Afia and she has betrayed him.&lt;ref name=Interview /&gt;  In an interview with ''Inside Soap'', Bhatti admits that he is sympathetic for his character, Yusef. He said that Yusef is very insecure and that he can understand his behaviour in some ways. Meanwhile, discussing the fan reaction to his character, Bhatti admitted that women have told him that he's a &quot;bad man&quot;. Bhatti also hinted that Yusef will become more firmly established as a Walford villain over the next few weeks, stating that Yusef does have more bad qualities than good and that fans call him &quot;Dr. Evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' actor admits Yusef sympathy|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a320976/eastenders-actor-admits-yusef-sympathy.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yusef is wrongly accused of having an affair with Zainab, due to his sister-in-law overhearing them speaking. A source said that the whole day turns into a disaster. When Shameem sees Yusef and Zainab together she automatically thinks they're having an affair and everyone struggles to come to terms with what they have heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title='EastEnders' Zainab 'wrongly accused of affair'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a324438/eastenders-zainab-wrongly-accused-of-affair.html|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=3 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhatti has admitted that he is surprised by his status as a [[Teen idol|heartthrob]]. Interviewed by Will Payne of the ''Sunday Mirror'', he said that it's a great compliment however, it was a complete surprise. Bhatti hinted that perhaps women love the character, but he prefer trainers and jeans to smart suits.&lt;ref name=&quot;WP&quot;/&gt;

====Kidnap====
In April&amp;nbsp;2011, it was reported that Masood would kidnap Yusef, pour petrol on him and threaten to set him on fire. Yusef will then go to the Masood's house and tell Zainab what Masood has done. An ''EastEnders'' insider told the ''[[News of the World]]'', &quot;Masood has never got over that. Tension has been simmering for a while and leads to an outpouring of violence from Masood that leaves Yusef seriously injured. But Yusef will get his own back. It is a twisted love triangle that will also show the sometimes brutal side of arranged marriages. It's not clear if their marriage will survive Yusef's meddling. [...] Yusef obviously wants [Zainab] back and will do anything he can to drive a wedge between Masood and Zainab.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yusef kidnapped&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a316158/eastenders-masood-to-kidnap-yusef.html|title='EastEnders' Masood 'to kidnap Yusef'|date=24 April 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ganatra said that Yusef will turn &quot;very manipulative and very nasty&quot; and Masood finds him as a big threat saying, &quot;He throws a real spanner in the works for Masood. [...] He is doing everything he can to wreck Masood's life, really, and the way you do that is to get to his family. It's a very clever way of doing things—it's not about destroying his family, it's about winning his family and turning them against him, so that Masood is left isolated and on his own.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nasty&quot;/&gt; Ganatra spoke of the storyline saying, &quot;I think there's rumours of revenge! Yusef is a really nice catalyst - he's a very exciting character to throw into the mix. If it goes that way, it's more drama for us to play.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bsa11&quot;/&gt; The scenes were broadcast on 2&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;2011 with Phil Mitchell also taking revenge alongside Masood.&lt;ref name=&quot;2june&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a320893/masood-and-phil-kidnap-a-terrified-yusef.html|title=Masood and Phil kidnap a terrified Yusef|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=2 June 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=24 May 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Domestic violence====
In late 2011, Yusef manages to win his former wife back. They later make plans to get married. Nina Wadia explains why Zainab is willing to forgive Yusef. Wadia said to ''[[Inside Soap]]'': &quot;He tells Zainab that he was forced to start the fire by his family. Yusef goes on to explain that he knew it was wrong the minute he lit the match, and that he ran into the house to save her. And by the end of this conversation, she finds herself saying to him, 'Let's get married' - regardless! Obviously, it was something I struggled to get my head around. But being burnt in that fire is what they both have in common - and that experience connects them so deeply. She recognises that he made a mistake but also decides that the whole thing was probably her fault, because she walked out on their marriage.&quot; Wadia continued: &quot;It doesn't look like Zainab's going to listen. But as Denise leaves, it's clear she's torn about what to do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Zainab Masood 'blames herself for fire'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a353954/eastenders-zainab-masood-blames-herself-for-fire.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A short time before their wedding day arrives, Yusef starts to abuse Zainab both physically and mentally. He forbids Zainab to leave the house and later starts using her son, Kamil, to control her. Wadia explains that she wants the storyline to have a positive impact against real-life violence. She told ''[[BBC News]]'' :&quot;I think the idea behind showing a strong woman like Zainab changing like this is to show that it can happen to even the strongest of women. They can change and they can be manipulated - especially if they're isolated from their friends and family. The manipulator can take advantage, so it's to prove that it can even happen to people like her. To be honest, if even one woman rings that Action Line at the end of the show and there's some difference made to her life, I'll feel like we've done our job,&quot; she continued. &quot;It is a serious issue and I'm glad it's being highlighted. I hope that it wakes anyone up - not just women, I know that there are abused men out there as well. So if it gives anyone the strength to leave a relationship like that, we'll have done our job.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Yusef plot should have positive impact, says Nina Wadia|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a356684/eastenders-yusef-plot-should-have-positive-impact-says-nina-wadia.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scenes where Yusef refused to let Zainab see Kamil pulled in 8.69m viewers at 7.30pm. BBC Three's repeat of the episode later secured 994k viewers at 10pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Yusef drama pulls in 8.7m|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a356934/eastenders-yusef-drama-pulls-in-87m.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=26 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadia admitted to feeling &quot;emotionally drained&quot; after her scenes with Ace Bhatti. She explained to ''[[The People]]'': &quot;It's very draining. I'm putting myself into this very dark place which I know sadly is a reality for so many women. Zainab's confidence has been steadily eroded. She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have found it hard to do. I've known Ace for a long time and we're good friends. He has been wonderful to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through.&quot; Wadia has been given advice on the storyline from the Roshni refuge in Birmingham, which specializes in abuse within Asian families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title='EastEnders' Nina Wadia 'emotionally drained' by Yusef plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a349396/eastenders-nina-wadia-emotionally-drained-by-yusef-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadia warns that Yusef will ultimately get worse as time progresses. She said to ''[[Inside Soap]]'': &quot;I was filming out on location recently with Ace and a bunch of women came over to him and said, 'God, you're such a horrible man!' It's funny because Ace is such a sweet man - and you haven't even seen the worst of Yusef yet!&quot; Wadia continued: &quot;Let's just say that what happens is the complete opposite of what you want to see. Zainab and Yusef share a dark and twisted love, and she definitely has feelings for him. It's not true and pure like what she used to have with Masood - and if Yusef manages to get her back to Pakistan, it will be the end for her. I wouldn't be surprised if Zainab ends up in some sort of home to recover from everything that's going to happen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' Yusef will get worse, warns Nina Wadia|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a347551/eastenders-yusef-will-get-worse-warns-nina-wadia.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote_box |width=30% |align=right|quote=&quot;&quot;At first, Masood is quite suspicious of Zainab and thinks that she's trying to stop him from seeing Kamil. But when he talks to Denise, he starts to see things differently.

Masood is still the only person who can see Yusef for what he really is, so he goes into a blind panic over the situation. Masood calls in the police, and they make sure that Kamil is safe, but we're left to wonder if he will stay that way. The police say that they can't get involved in domestic disputes, so Masood says, 'Well, what about the father's rights? If a mother reported this, you'd see it as kidnap'. I thought that was a great line and really interesting - I think in that moment, Masood's representing a lot of fathers who have separated or divorced and don't have access to their children in the same way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganatra Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders' star Nitin Ganatra talks Masood family's Christmas plot|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/interviews/a356601/eastenders-star-nitin-ganatra-talks-masood-familys-christmas-plot.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines]]|accessdate=22 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asked what Masood's reactions are over Zainab's abuse, Nitin says: &quot;Masood tells Denise, 'It's just another one of Zainab's dramas', but then there comes a point where he sees bruises on Zainab. Then Masood becomes very concerned for Zainab in a very genuine way. It also might reignite something between the two of them as well, as they have to work together to solve these problems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ganatra Interview&quot; /&gt; The scenes showing Masood and Denise race to the café where Kamil was raised 8.26 million viewers.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Frederick J. Griffiths''' (December 11, 1878 - October 17, 1951) was an early, [[England|English-born]] engineer in the [[Stark County, Ohio]] steel industry. He is best known for working with [[Henry Ford]] to develop a [[vanadium]] alloy steel in order to produce lighter-weight, stronger automobiles. When the Massillon Rolling Mill Company merged into the Central Steel Company in June 1914, Griffiths resigned as a chemist at Canton’s United Steel Company to become Central's vice president and superintendent. He then became the president of the company. His daughter, Gertrude, lit the first open hearth furnace at the new Central Steel Company in 1915. In 1917, Griffith's was named to the Massillon Steel Casting Company board of directors. The company's earliest orders came from the [[United States military]] for production of the steel-rated equipment and supplies needed for [[World War I]]. By 1919, 3 of his 5 brothers were all superintendents at Central Steel.

In 1920, Griffiths was anticipated by many in [[Massillon, Ohio]] to purchase the [[Massillon Tigers]], of the [[Ohio League]] and take the team into the new [[National Football League]]. However he never attended a meeting regarding the league or club and the Tigers soon folded.

When Central Steel became part of Central Alloy Steel Company, Griffiths became chairman of its board of trustees. However when that firm was absorbed by the [[Republic Steel Corporation]], he was assigned the presidency of the Republic Research Corporation. Not wanting to conduct research, Griffth's left Republic to join the Timken Company.

The '''2011 MLS SuperDraft''' was the twelfth annual [[MLS SuperDraft|SuperDraft]] presented by [[Major League Soccer]].  It was held on January 13, 2011 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], during the 2011 [[National Soccer Coaches Association of America|NSCAA]] Convention at the [[Baltimore Convention Center]]. The 2011 SuperDraft consisted of three rounds with eighteen selections each, for a total of 54 players selected during the draft. The draft preceded the [[2011 MLS season]].&lt;ref group=&quot;ref&quot; name=&quot;seattle_times&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== Changes from 2010 ==

* As expansion clubs, Vancouver and Portland received the first and second picks in the SuperDraft.
* The SuperDraft has contracted in number of rounds, from four to three, making it the shortest SuperDraft in terms of rounds.

==Player selection==

54 players were selected during the 3 rounds. [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] had the first overall selection in the 2011 SuperDraft, followed by [[Portland Timbers]]. The following eight selections were from teams that failed to qualify for the [[2010 MLS Cup Playoffs]], starting with the team holding the lowest amount of 2010 regular season points (3 points per win, one point per draw). The subsequent eight selection positions of clubs were sorted by fewest regular season points, from among teams that went out in the same round of the MLS Cup Playoffs. As similar in other drafts, teams were allowed to trade these rights away to other teams for other rights such as players, special roster spots, or other rights of interest. Participating players in the 2011 draw were confirmed in December 2010..&lt;ref group=&quot;ref&quot; name=&quot;seattle_times&quot;/&gt;

On January 5, 2011, MLS announced that it was eliminating the previously planned fourth-round of the 2011 SuperDraft and re-introducing a three-round [[MLS Supplemental Draft|Supplemental Draft]].  Previously traded fourth-round 2011 SuperDraft selections became traded first-round [[2011 MLS Supplemental Draft]] selections.&lt;ref group=&quot;ref&quot; name=&quot;announcement&quot;/&gt;

The selection order was released by the league on January 7, 2011.&lt;ref group=&quot;ref&quot; name=&quot;SelectionOrder&quot;/&gt;

== Other Draft Day Trades ==
* [[Los Angeles Galaxy]] acquired forward [[Chad Barrett]] from [[Toronto FC]] in exchange for future considerations.&lt;ref group=&quot;ref&quot; name=&quot;Barrett&quot;/&gt; Ives Galarcep reported that the future considerations consisted of $125,000 in allocation money and TFC assuming a portion of Barrett's salary.

== Trade notes ==
* [[Real Salt Lake]] acquired midfielder [[Will Johnson (soccer)|Will Johnson]] from [[Chicago Fire S.C.|Chicago Fire]] in a trade on 22 August 2008. In return, Chicago was to receive a natural fourth-round [[2009 MLS SuperDraft]] selection and a second-round 2011 SuperDraft selection from RSL.&lt;ref group=&quot;ref&quot; name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt; However, the trade also contained a clause that allowed Chicago to receive allocation money in lieu of the draft picks.  Chicago chose the allocation money.

* [[San Jose Earthquakes]] acquired a conditional 2011 SuperDraft selection and a second-round [[2010 MLS SuperDraft]] selection (#28) from [[Real Salt Lake]] in exchange for forward [[Pablo Campos]] on July 15, 2009.&lt;ref group=&quot;ref&quot; name=&quot;Campos&quot;/&gt; The conditional 2011 selection was contingent on Campos starting 8 games for Real Salt Lake in 2009. Campos started only 5 games so San Jose did not receive the conditional 2011 draft pick.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Kate Osann''' was an American cartoonist. She created the comic strip ''Tizzy.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Kate Osann Cartoons &quot;&gt;[http://library.syr.edu/digital/guides/o/osann_k.htm#d0e144 Kate Osann Cartoons] Syracuse University, 26 Jan 2009, Retrieved 11/16/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Osann was born in [[St. Louis]], Missouri, but grew up in New York City. She graduated from [[Hunter College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kate Osann Cartoons &quot;/&gt;

==Career==
Early in her career, Osann worked on ads and illustrating for such magazines as ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' and ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]''. Osann was a regular contributor to ''Collier's,'' where her panel style cartoon, ''Tizzy'', first appeared. After the demise of ''Collier's Weekly'' in 1957, ''Tizzy'' cartoons ran with [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]], until 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kate Osann Cartoons &quot;/&gt;

Tizzy, the title character, was a stereotypical teen-aged American girl. In ''Collier's'', the ''Tizzy'' cartoons were in color and Tizzy's hair was red. The syndicated cartoons were in black and white, and Tizzy's hair was blonde. When the color cartoons were reprinted in black and white in the first Tizzy paperback book, Tizzy's red hair was rendered as black.&lt;ref&gt;Collier's: A. Vol.137 No.2, 20 Jan. 1956, page 70; B. Vol.137 No.7, 30 March 1956, page 72; C. Vol.137 No.9, 27 April 1956, page 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Osann, Kate. Tizzy: That Lovable, Laughable, Teen-Ager. New York, Berkley Publishing Corp., 1958. Pages 53, 6, and 79, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tizzy wore [[horn-rimmed glasses]] with triangular lenses. In the ''Collier's'' cartoons, the temples of her glasses were clearly visible. In the syndicated cartoons, the temples were rarely seen, and the frames appeared to be resting on her nose alone.

==Books==
During the late 1950s and 1960s, three ''Tizzy'' paperback books were published: ''Tizzy: That Loveable, Laughable Teen-Ager'' (Berkeley, 1958), ''More Tizzy'' (Berkeley, 1958), and ''Tizzy'' (Scholastic Book Services 1967). Tizzy cartoons illustrated ''Baby-Sitter's Guide'', by Sharon Sherman (Scholastic Book Services, 1969).&lt;ref name=&quot;Kate Osann Cartoons &quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alibris.com/search/books/author/Kate%20Osann&lt;/ref&gt;

==&quot;Kate O'Sann&quot;==
Three books were published in the 1970s with her name spelled with an apostrophe, &quot;Kate O'Sann.&quot;

The book ''Men!'', edited by Kitty Clevenger and Aileen Neighbors, was published by Hallmark Editions in 1974. It was illustrated by Kate O'Sann. The rear flap of the dust jacket was devoted to a self-portrait of Kate O'Sann, and a brief biography of her which reads in part, &quot;Illustrator Kate O'sann, a native of Missouri, grew up in New York City, where she received her Bachelor of Arts degree from [[Hunter College]] and was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. She makes her home in [[Orlando, Florida]], with her husband, William O. Chessman, and 'two large and vocal children' - William and Kathy.&quot;

The books ''Kid's Cookery'' and ''Things Girls Like to Draw'' were written and illustrated by Kate O'Sann. They were
published in 1979 by International Media Systems, of [[Longwood, Florida]].

O'Sann was written with a lower case letter &quot;s&quot; in ''Men!'', but with a capital letter &quot;S&quot; in ''Kid's Cookery'' and ''Things Girls Like to Draw''.

'''Anime Festival Asia (AFA)''' is a series of [[anime]] conventions held in the [[Southeast Asia]]n region, with a core annual convention held in Singapore. The main convention is traditionally held over a weekend in mid-November. It was held at the [[Suntec Singapore International Convention and Exhibition Centre]] in 2008–2011, but was moved to the [[Singapore Expo|Singapore Expo MAX Pavilion]] in 2012 due to renovation works at Suntec Convention Centre that year. Satellite conventions were also held in 2012 at the [[Putra World Trade Centre]], [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia; and at the Jakarta International Expo, [[Kemayoran]], [[Jakarta]], Indonesia.

Alongside the main conventions, AFA also holds periodic business conferences focusing on the anime and manga industry. The first of these was Animation Asia Conference, held in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAC-2009&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.onscreenasia.com/article/animation-asia-conference-2009/6526|title = Animation Asia Conference 2009|publisher = Onscreen Asia|accessdate = 2013-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AFA is notable for having one of the largest attendance figures for anime conventions outside of Japan, with 82,000 attendees in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC-2011-A&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/lifestyle/story/anime-festival-asia-20121111|title = Anime Festival Asia sees tens of thousands of fans attend|publisher = The Straits Times|accessdate = 2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Delete''' None of the positions he has held confer notability. Barristers and advisers to politicians aren't notable roles in themselves. The sourcing simply confirms that he is a local councillor who has been involved in a few local news stories. Nothing of significance beyond that.
