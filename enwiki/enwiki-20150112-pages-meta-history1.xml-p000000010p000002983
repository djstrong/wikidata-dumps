      <text xml:space="preserve">''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

Libertarian socialism traces its tradition back to the eighteenth (can anyone give any reference???) and nineteenth centuries (see Proudhon, Kropotkin, Bakunin, etc.).

Few left-anarchists are actually violent, but throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, the violent kind has made &quot;anarchism&quot; famous as an ideology justifying murder and bombing. Most left-anarchists are not immediately violent, although many advocate a future revolution. The position of left-anarchists regarding violence, what legitimizes it or not, and how can justice exist with or without violence is not clear, though.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of all forms of [[government]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean an abolition of all forms of hierarchy: political, economic, and otherwise; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

In different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.

Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Most Famous Anarchists ===

Here is a small selection of most famous anarchists. For more, see in various categories.
* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]
* [[Peter Kroptkin]] (1842-1921), credited as first theorist of anarcho-communism (an advance on Bakunin's anarchist-collectivism)
* [[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819 - 1912), first theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomy]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Kropotkin]], and [[Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].

Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used improperly as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[PeterKropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism.

'''Anarchism''' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used improperly as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[PeterKropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.


On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

* [[Russian Revolution]] - After the overthrow of the czarist state, many revolutionary movements sprang up all throughout the collapsing Russian Empire. Notable amongst these was an anarchist peasant movement in the Ukraine, usually known as the Makhnovists due to the influence of [[Nestor Makhno]], an anarchist peasant/general. The Makhnovists organized resistance against the White counterrevolution, and later on against the consolidation of power by the Bolsheviks, but were eventually crushed.

* [[Mexican Revolution]] - The revolutionary period in Mexico was an extended period usually considered to have begun with the overthrow of the dictator [[Porfirio Diaz]] and the installation of the moderate [[Francisco Madero]]. Instrumental in this transfer of power were the likes of [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], a mestizo peasant from the state of Morelos. Zapata and his followers, the [[Zapatistas]], mostly [[Mayans|Mayan Indians]], advocated for a program of radical land reform under the slogan &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;, or &quot;Land and Liberty&quot;. This demand, laid out roughly in the Zapatista's Plan de Ayala, sought to break up the large landholdings (fincas) which maintained power in the hands of the landlords (finqueros) and kept the Indian peasants chained into a system of lifelong debt slavery (peonage). This Zapatista movement was eventually augmented by intellectuals from Mexico City, including the anarchist [[Antonio Diaz Soto Y Gama]] and the brothers Jesus and [[Ricardo Flores Magon]] (who coined the phrase &quot;Land &amp; Liberty&quot; that Zapata adopted). These intellectuals, more articulate than the illiterate peasants (probably including Zapata himself) became the voice for the Zapatista movement. Zapata quickly broke with Madero, who he felt was not moving quickly enough in the area of land reform, and continued to fight his government and the successive governments of [[Victoriano Huerta]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Madero, Huerta and Carranza fought each other for control of the Mexican state, but all agreed that Zapata was a thorn that had to be removed. Eventually, after many years of fighting, Carranza succeeded in having Zapata assassinated (on April 10, 1917), and subduing the Zapatista forces.

'''Anarchism''' is the [[political]] theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of [[government]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.

These divisions are excarbated by a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used improperly as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.

While some historians trace the roots of (European) anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[PeterKropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), [[non-violence]], [[cooperativism]] and [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Bakunin]] was thrown out of the International by Karl [[Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  President [[Mckinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violence]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many Libertarian Socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] and [[cooperativism]].  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.


=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

* [[IWW]] - The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or &quot;Wobblies&quot;) were an anarcho-syndicalist labor union that was prominent in labor struggles in early 20th century America. They advocated the formation of &quot;one big union&quot; comprised of all workers everywhere. The IWW made use of militant tactics in order to effect their demands for improvement in worker's conditions, including sabotage, and popularized the &quot;wildcat strike&quot;, a sudden, unannounced work stoppage, as a means of fighting. While they never advocated straight out violence, they were clear in their intent to defend themselves if attacked, and fought back with force against policemen and Pinkerton security guards. The Wobblies were unabashedly revolutionary (as many labor unions were at the time) and saw their struggle for worker's rights only as a tool towards the eventual worker takeover of factories that the syndicalists envisioned at the time. They were racially inclusive, recognizing that black workers and white workers faced the same oppression (in a time when many labor unions were exclusive). They faced fierce resistance, both from the bosses themselves and from the federal government. This resistance, and the slow process of attrition of revolutionary potential as labor unions forced concessions from the capitalists, reduced the IWW to tatters by the early twenties. They still survive in some form and are organizing workers to this day. Their website is [http://www.iww.org here].

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.

Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===

* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

* [[Russian Revolution]] - After the overthrow of the czarist state, many revolutionary movements sprang up all throughout the collapsing Russian Empire. Notable amongst these was an anarchist peasant movement in the Ukraine, usually known as the Makhnovists due to the influence of [[Nestor Makhno]], an anarchist peasant/general. The Makhnovists organized resistance against the White counterrevolution, and later on against the consolidation of power by the Bolsheviks, but were eventually crushed.

* [[Mexican Revolution]] - The revolutionary period in Mexico was an extended period usually considered to have begun with the overthrow of the dictator [[Porfirio Diaz]] and the installation of the moderate [[Francisco Madero]]. Instrumental in this transfer of power were the likes of [[Pancho Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], a mestizo peasant from the state of Morelos. Zapata and his followers, the [[Zapatistas]], mostly [[Mayans|Mayan Indians]], advocated for a program of radical land reform under the slogan &quot;Tierra y Libertad&quot;, or &quot;Land and Liberty&quot;. This demand, laid out roughly in the Zapatista's Plan de Ayala, sought to break up the large landholdings (fincas) which maintained power in the hands of the landlords (finqueros) and kept the Indian peasants chained into a system of lifelong debt slavery (peonage). This Zapatista movement was eventually augmented by intellectuals from Mexico City, including the anarchist [[Antonio Diaz Soto Y Gama]] and the brothers Jesus and [[Ricardo Flores Magon]] (who coined the phrase &quot;Land &amp; Liberty&quot; that Zapata adopted). These intellectuals, more articulate than the illiterate peasants (probably including Zapata himself) became the voice for the Zapatista movement. Zapata quickly broke with Madero, who he felt was not moving quickly enough in the area of land reform, and continued to fight his government and the successive governments of [[Victoriano Huerta]] and [[Venustiano Carranza]]. Madero, Huerta and Carranza fought each other for control of the Mexican state, but all agreed that Zapata was a thorn that had to be removed. Eventually, after many years of fighting, Carranza succeeded in having Zapata assassinated (on April 10, 1917), and subduing the Zapatista forces.

* [[IWW]] - The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW, or &quot;Wobblies&quot;) were an anarcho-syndicalist labor union that was prominent in labor struggles in early 20th century America. They advocated the formation of &quot;one big union&quot; comprised of all workers everywhere. The IWW made use of militant tactics in order to effect their demands for improvement in worker's conditions, including sabotage, and popularized the &quot;wildcat strike&quot;, a sudden, unannounced work stoppage, as a means of fighting. While they never advocated straight out violence, they were clear in their intent to defend themselves if attacked, and fought back with force against policemen and Pinkerton security guards. The Wobblies were unabashedly revolutionary (as many labor unions were at the time) and saw their struggle for worker's rights only as a tool towards the eventual worker takeover of factories that the syndicalists envisioned at the time. They were racially inclusive, recognizing that black workers and white workers faced the same oppression (in a time when many labor unions were exclusive). They faced fierce resistance, both from the bosses themselves and from the federal government. This resistance, and the slow process of attrition of revolutionary potential as labor unions forced concessions from the capitalists, reduced the IWW to tatters by the early twenties. They still survive in some form and are organizing workers to this day. Their website is [http://www.iww.org here].

'''Anarchism''' is the [[political]] theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of [[government]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

Different groups have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean an abolition of all forms of hierarchy: political, economic, and otherwise; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

These visions have created a very polemical debate around the names of various types of anarchism and related ideas.  For example, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;.  The unadorned word 'anarchist' popularly denotes this brand of anarchist.

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.


Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.


On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other's ideas with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.

Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists could arguably claim &lt;i&gt;they&lt;/i&gt; are the oldest anarchist tradition, but they care little for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions, since they don't feel like they are part of a collective they must defend.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of all forms of [[government]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean an abolition of all forms of hierarchy: political, economic, and otherwise; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

In different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist.  In the United States, &quot;libertarianism&quot; typically does not refer to either anarchism or socialism, while in e.g. Latin America it refers to both.  Finally, the term &quot;anarchy&quot; is frequently used as a perjorative in reference to [[anomie]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;.  The unadorned word 'anarchist' popularly denotes this brand of anarchist.

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes escalated into near-insurrections.  In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[regicide]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent.  In fact there is no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence among libertarian socialists.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among many anarchists; others believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified in reaction to what they see as oppression.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Massacre]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;.

This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

''How about someone else than me ;) put in their favorite list of healthy, functioning anarchies here?''

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

Here is a small selection of some well known figures in anarchist history and thought. For others, see in various categories.
* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]
* [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842-1921), credited as first theorist of anarcho-communism (an advance on Bakunin's anarchist-collectivism)
* [[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819 - 1912), first theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]]
* [[Benjamin Tucker]] (1854 - 1939), great defender of [[individualist anarchism]]

* [[Alan Albon]] ([[Freedom]] anarchist fortnightly)
* [[Murray Bookchin]] (leading [[social ecology]] thinker and writer)

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)]] (metal band)
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.

This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condened by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]

However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all forms of coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negoiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature}.

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===

Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

Here is a small selection of some well known figures in anarchist history and thought. For others, see in various categories.
* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]
* [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842-1921), credited as first theorist of anarcho-communism (an advance on Bakunin's anarchist-collectivism)
* [[Gustave de Molinari]] (1819 - 1912), first theorist of [[anarcho-capitalism]]
* [[Benjamin Tucker]] (1854 - 1939), great defender of [[individualist anarchism]]

* [[Murray Bookchin]] (leading [[social ecology]] thinker and writer)
* [[Lysander Spooner]]

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[The Ex]]
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)

See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

* [[Michael Bakunin]] (1814 - 1876), well-known early [[libertarian socialism|socialist anarchist]]

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)

===Anarchism in history===

==Spanish Civil War==

After [[Franco|Franco's]] insurrection in [[July 1936]], a spontaneous social revolution occured in which the [[CNT]], a broadly anarchist union, took control of various &quot;key industries&quot; in [[Catalonia]] especially (as [[George Orwell]] tells us in his [[Homage to Catalonia|personal account of the war]]).

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Anarchism'' is the political theory that advocates the abolition of all forms of government. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).



Different groups have radically different understandings of what the abolition of governments would entail: &quot;[[libertarian socialism|Libertarian socialists]]&quot; are convinced it means a collectivist economy; &quot;[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]&quot; are convinced it means capitalism; &quot;[[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]]&quot; don't know or don't care as much about such issues, but insist above all on individual freedom from state.



=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===

This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, notably with collective ownership of means of production, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].



Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves '[[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]]' or 'left anarchists', to distinguish themselves from anarcho-capitalists. However, the mere word 'anarchist' popularly denote this brand of anarchists.



Libertarian socialism traces its tradition back to the eighteenth (can anyone give any reference???) and nineteenth centuries (see Proudhon, Kropotkin, Bakunin, etc.).



Few left-anarchists are actually violent, but throughout the late 19th and early 20th century, the violent kind has made &quot;anarchism&quot; famous as an ideology justifying murder and bombing. Most left-anarchists are not immediately violent, although many advocate a future revolution. The position of left-anarchists regarding violence, what legitimizes it or not, and how can justice exist with or without violence is not clear, though.



=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===

The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.



Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves '[[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]'.



Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.



Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.



=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===

There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] which are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.



Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches rather than collectivism. They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.



On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail, as long as individual freedom is respected.



=== Anarchy ([[Anomy]]) ===

The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what scholars call &quot;anomy&quot; (absence of order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.



This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomy has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].



=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===

Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.



Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, which constitutes a de facto government, and should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider that an employer-employee relationship is an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is a form of oppressive de facto government.



Libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists view each other with hostility. Proponents of each of these two theories tend to claim that theirs is the only true anarchism, while the other position is not anarchism at all, because it opposes a wrong notion of power ('archos'). On the other hand, libertarian socialists consider themselves as part of the collectivist movement, while anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as classical liberals - this shows that the opposition between collectivism and individualism in matters of political economy is indeed more essential than the question of the existence of government.



Many libertarian socialists argue that anarcho-capitalism should not be called anarchism at all, due to the much older use of the word to refer to libertarian socialism. Anarcho-capitalists argue they have just as much right to the word as libertarian socialists have, and that their anti-statist tradition is actually older and more coherent. Individualist anarchists don't care much for such macho &quot;length contests&quot; about the age of traditions.



=== Historical Anarchist Movements ===



* [[Spanish Civil War]] - During the Spanish civil war, the anti-[[fascism|fascist]] forces were comprised of various factions including communists and anarchists. Anarchist groups controlled both territory and factories for a time during the war. Fights broke out between the communists and anarchist in some cities. One of the anarchist groups from that time, the CNT (Confederación National del Trabajo), still exists in Spain and has [http://www.cnt.es/ a website].

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.



=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)
* [[The Ex]]

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with governments replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from state.  

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution.

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

''Please classify the following thinkers into one (or more) of the categories above, then remove this section.''

* [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] (1866 - 1912)
* [[Miguel Garcia]]

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)
* [[The Ex]]

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the illegitimate use terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. 

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== A Few Famous Anarchists ===

''Please classify the following thinkers into one (or more) of the categories above, then remove this section.''

* [[Voltairine de Cleyre]] (1866 - 1912)
* [[Miguel Garcia]]

==Anarchist musicians==

In the past few decades, anarchism has been associated with the punk rock movement, and has grown because of that association (whatever other effects that has had on the movement and the prejudiced pictures of it). Following is some of the more famous anarchist musicians; that is, musicians who happen to be vocally anarchist.

* [[Anarcho-punk]]
* [[John Cage]]
* [[Manu Chao]] (latin folk singer)
* [[Chumbawamba]]
* [[Crass]] (Anarchist/pacifist 'punk' band)
* [[One Minute Silence (band)|One Minute Silence]] (metal band)
* [[The Ex]]

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]].

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

While some historians trace the roots of European anarchism to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century.  Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  Bakunin was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

Similarly, there is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalist communes]] ===

Prominant during the mid tenth century, anarcho-syndicalist communes functioned by allowing members to take turns acting as a sort of executive office for the week. All deceisions of that officer had to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of all external affairs. Anarcho-syndicalistic communists believe that supreme executive power derivces from a mandate from the masses, not from ceremonial tradition.

There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of some or all forms of [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
The theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Anarcho-syndicalist communes]] ===

Prominant during the mid tenth century, anarcho-syndicalist communes functioned by allowing members to take turns acting as a sort of executive office for the week. All deceisions of that officer had to be ratified at a special biweekly meeting by a simple majority in the case of purely internal affairs, but by a two-thirds majority in the case of all external affairs. Anarcho-syndicalistic communists believe that supreme executive power derivces from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

This line of anarchist thought can be more accurately called ''[[libertarian socialism]]''. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]].

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]], and [[pacifism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]]. 

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism -- then often referred to simply as &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot; -- sprouted from the growth of [[socialism]].

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.

*  Anarcho-socialists counter that as no ordinary (as opposed to someone who is independently wealthy) person can refuse to work, there is no freedom involved in the negotiation of a contract with an employer (the &quot;weakness and ignorance&quot; refered to above, or the [[wage slave]] concept referred to in socialist literature).

*  Anarcho-capitalists in return argue that, no matter what social organization may or may not exist, social organizations will never eliminate the basic human requirement to work in order to support themselves.  Therefore an objection based on a constraint that cannot be overcome is useless to argue about, and not a rational objection at all.

=== Anarchies functioning today ===

Anarchies functioning during the first decade of the 21st century include the [[usenet]], [[indymedia]], the [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] community, the [[Wikipedia]] community itself, and other sub-societies which are generally networked using the internet.

They operate using de facto [[anarchist law]] which does not use prison systems, does not use violence, and in which enforcement generally happens by polite and rational discussion on publicly archived mailing lists, so that even emotional coercion and manipulation are discouraged because they require secrecy in order to function.

=== Anarchism and [[terrorism]] ===

Late in the 19th century, anarchist labor unions began to use the tactic of [[General_Strike|general strike]].  This was often met with violence and some of the strikes even resulted in massacres.

In this climate, a minority of anarchists began to advocate [[terrorism]], which they referred to as &quot;propaganda of the deed.&quot;  United States President [[William McKinley]], among others, was assassinated by an anarchist.

This has left a lasting public impression that libertarian socialists are violent terrorists, a prejudice not aided by events such as the [[Haymarket Riot]], where anarchists were (probably wrongly) blamed for throwing a bomb at police who came to break up a public meeting in [[Chicago]]. Nowadays the use of terrorism is condemned by all libertarian socialists, but there is still no consensus on the legitimacy or utility of violence.  The Tolstoian tradition of [[non-violent resistance]] is prevalent among most anarchists; the rest believe that violence (especially [[self-defense]] and [[property damage]]) is justified as the way to provoke social upheaval which could lead to a social revolution. 

The idea that anarchists are particularly violent takes another blow when one looks further into anarchist theory: notably, [[Emma Goldman]] included in her definition of Anarchism the observation that all governments rest on violence, and this is one of the many reasons they should be opposed. Goldman herself didn't oppose tactics like assassination until she went to Russia, where she witnessed the violence of the Russian state and the [[Red Army]]. From then on she condemned the use of terrorism, especially by the state, and advocted violence only as a means of self-defense.

'''Anarchism''' is a name taken by various [[politics|political]] theories which advocate the abolition of [[totalitarian]] [[authority]]. The word anarchism derives from Greek roots &lt;i&gt;an&lt;/i&gt; (no) and &lt;i&gt;archos&lt;/i&gt; (ruler).

These theories have radically different visions of what anarchism means: [[libertarian socialism|libertarian socialists]] intend anarchism to mean the replacement of all forms of hierarchy (political, economic, and otherwise) by democratically-controled and collectively-owned organizations; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]] envision a capitalist society with [[government|governments]] replaced by capitalist institutions; [[individualist anarchism|individualist anarchists]] insist above all on individual freedom from [[state|the state]]. 

Although in different places, &quot;anarchism&quot; is variously understood as being either socialist or capitalist, when unadorned, however, anarchism popularly denotes [[libertarian socialism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]], [[democracy]],[[pacifism]], and [[syndicalism]]. 

While it might seem that &quot;anarchism&quot; implies a total lack of [[law]], many &quot;anarchists&quot; believe that there ''should'' exist organised structures in society, but that these should be created in a way that no hierarchies develop.
This is reflected in the phrase: ''Anarchy means no rulers, not no rules.''
This is why [[anarchist law|anarchist legal systems]] exist de facto in anarchies functioning today.

===The roots of anarchism===

The philosophy of anarchism can be traced to movements such as the [[Free Spirit]] in the middle ages, and even as far back as [[Ancient Greece]], where the philosopher [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]] denied the morality of the [[State]]. In fact, it is generally understood that anarchism seeks to retrieve some aspect of [[society]] from the depths of [[prehistory]]. However, there was no cohesive ideology until the nineteenth century, when anarchism became appeared alongside &quot;[[Revolutionary Socialism]]&quot;

=== [[Libertarian socialism]] ===
This theory of anarchism calls for a system of socialism, with collective ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organizations, without the need for any government authority or [[coercion]].

Adherents of this view sometimes call themselves &lt;b&gt;libertarian socialists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;libertarian communists&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;left-anarchists&lt;/b&gt;, or &lt;b&gt;anarcho-communists&lt;/b&gt;. 

Major advocates of anarchism in that era included [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]], [[Peter Kropotkin]], and [[Mikhail Bakunin]].  Their writings revolved around [[atheism]] (with a few exceptions, like Tolstoy), and cooperative economics based on [[mutual aid]].  Anarchist labor unions were a significant element in the social struggles of that era, and many experiments in cooperative living, education, and other institutions were made.  [[Mikhail Bakunin]], one of the first and most prominent libertarian socialists, was thrown out of the International by [[Karl Marx]], which began a long-lasting split between left-anarchists and communists.  

There is no consensus on what type of socialism libertarian socialists advocate.  Many libertarian socialists employ criticisms of capitalism which are similar to those advocated by Marxists.  Others focus on [[mutual aid]] from an anthropoligical perspective.  [[Anarcho-syndicalists]] see labor unions as the critical organizing structures of an anarchist economy.

=== [[Anarcho-capitalism]] ===
Proponents of this theory believe the theory of anarchism, based on individualism and natural law, calls for the abolition of any government control or regulation, and promotes [[capitalism|capitalist]] private businesses to replace all of current government's activities.

Adherents of this theory of anarchism call themselves &lt;b&gt;anarcho-capitalists&lt;/b&gt;.

Anarcho-capitalism has existed in its modern form at least since Gustave de Molinari in the 1840s, but has mostly been flourishing since it organized in the 1950s in the USA. Anarcho-capitalists consider themselves as radical members of the [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] tradition ('[[libertarianism]]' as it is now called in the USA), and trace their explicit roots back to [[John Locke|Locke]] and the seventeenth century english Whigs. All classical liberals believe in 'as little government as possible'; [[anarcho-capitalism|anarchists]] among them believe governments can and must be done without completely, whereas [[minarchism|minarchists]] believe or accept that some government be necessary for e.g. enforcing law and order.

Anarcho-capitalists, like classical liberals in general, tend to loathe violent action and revolutions as a &quot;normal&quot; way to promote or impose their views, even in presence of governments they hate. However, they do support, e.g. the american revolution, that precisely consisted in individuals sharing common views fighting together, against people trying to impose their views on them.

=== [[Individualist anarchism]] ===
There are several anarchist thinkers, such as [[Benjamin Tucker]], [[Lysander Spooner]] and [[Max Stirner]] who are known as individualist anarchists. Beyond economic issues of collectivism vs capitalism, they insist on individual liberty and absence of coercion from state.

Like libertarian socialists, they loathe government-supported capitalism, and reject several essential principles of capitalism in general. Like anarcho-capitalists, they put an emphasis on individual rights and liberty, and on market-based approaches.  They are thus acknowledged both by libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists, although each side accepts or criticizes differently the works of these thinkers. See [[individualist anarchism]] for a discussion of this issue.

On the debate of capitalism vs socialism, the reply of modern individualist anarchism is to let each individual choose the system he is willing to adhere to, and, with experience, each will choose what suits him best; to them, it doesn't matter which system will majoritarily prevail (which doesn't prevent each of them from making one's own educated guess), as long as individual freedom is respected.

=== Anarchy as [[Anomie]] ===
The popular meaning of anarchy as absolute chaos and disorder, what some scholars call by Durkheim's sociological term &quot;anomie&quot; (absence of standards, values or order), is rejected by all the above anarchist traditions - they think that government is actually a source of disorder, and that society would be more orderly without any.  Anarchy and anomie in this context are most often ''not'' intended situations, and are more an extension of what the opponents of anarchy imagine would result from if anarchists of any kind were to take power.

This usage has strong negative connotations, and has historically been used as a slur by political groups against their opponents, most notably by monarchists against republicans in past centuries. However, anomie has also been embraced by countercultural elements such as [[punk rock]].

=== Libertarian socialism vs. Anarcho-capitalism ===
Both libertarian socialists and anarcho-capitalists share an opposition to states and governments; but beyond that they disagree vehemently.  Libertarian socialists consider that an employer-employee relationship is based on coercion by the employer, and that all coercion should be prevented, even if oppressed employees are passively consenting out of weakness and ignorance. Anarcho-capitalists consider an employer-employee relationship to be an elaborate and mutually profitable form of voluntary association, and that any external power capable of preventing it is itself oppression.

Some commentators frame this debate as follows:

*  Anarcho-socialists (Libertarian Socialists) believe that all forms of hierarchy must be eliminated.  Anarcho-capitalists believe that all coercive forms of hierarchy must be eliminated, thus employer / employee relationships may be preserved, as they are freely entered into contracts.
