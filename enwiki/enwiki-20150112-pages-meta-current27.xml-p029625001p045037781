'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Rossiben, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Rossiben|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Online Galleries]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:
* [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|Starting an article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Biographies of living persons]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]] or ask me on my talk page. &lt;!-- Template:First article --&gt; Again, welcome!&amp;nbsp;[[User:Daemonic Kangaroo|Daemonic Kangaroo]] ([[User talk:Daemonic Kangaroo|talk]]) 17:25, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Online Galleries]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Online Galleries|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Online Galleries|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Daemonic Kangaroo|Daemonic Kangaroo]] ([[User talk:Daemonic Kangaroo|talk]]) 17:25, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, at least one of [[Special:Contributions/Roisinhynes|your recent edits]], such as the one you made to [[:Teapot]], did not appear to be constructive and has been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]] or removed.

A tag has been placed on [[:30% Club]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a club, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:30% Club|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:30% Club|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

{{Expand German|Die Weber|date=March 2011}}
[[File:Die Weber 1897 by Emil Orlik.jpeg|thumb|320px|An 1897 poster for a performance of the play.]]
'''''The Weavers''''' ({{lang-de|Die Weber}}, [[Silesian German]]: {{lang|sli|''De Waber''}}) is a play written by the German playwright [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] in 1892. The play sympathetically portrays a group of [[Silesia]]n [[weavers]] who staged an [[History of Silesia#Uprising of the Silesian weavers|uprising during the 1840s]] due to their concerns about the [[Industrial Revolution]].

The play was translated to [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] by [[Pinchas Goldhar]] in the 1920s, after which it became a favorite of the Yiddish stage. In 1927 it was adapted into a German silent film ''[[The Weavers (1927 film)|The Weavers]]'' directed by [[Frederic Zelnik]] and starring [[Paul Wegener]]. A Broadway version of ''The Weavers'' was staged in 1915–1916.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=8241 ''The Weavers''] at the [[Internet Broadway Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
Most of the characters are proletarians struggling for their rights. Unlike most plays of any period, as pointed out many times in literature criticism and introductions, the play has no true central character, providing ample opportunities for ensemble acting.

==Criticism==
Barrett H. Clark's comments: &quot;as one of Gerhart Hauptmann's experiments in dramatic form, ''The Weavers'' is highly significant. Instead of a hero, he has created a mob; this mob is therefore the protagonist—or chief character—and if individuals emerge from the rank and file they are not thrust into the foreground to stay long. It is the weavers as a class that are ever before us, and the unity of the play is in them and in them alone; they are only parts of a larger picture which will take shape as the story advances, and are not intended to be taken as important individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barrett H. Clark. ''The Continental Drama of Today'' pp. 89–93 (1914) Henry Holt and Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

No problem. Here are the issues:
*&quot;She debuted in December 2000, wearing a mask and wrestling as &quot;The Queen of the Cats&quot; La Felina in the Southern Ontario-based Apocalypse Wrestling Federation and was eventually unmasked by Tracy Brooks in a &quot;Mask versus Hair&quot; match&quot; too much of a run-on; split the sentences.
*&quot;there she successfully retain the title&quot; retained.
*&quot;early-2010&quot; I'm pretty sure that dash isn't needed.
*'which was won by the later.&quot; latter

Just a couple things. Article will be put on hold and passed when the issues are fixed.

*Does her brother have an article to link to? If not no big deal.
**Nope, no article. Don't even know his real name actually.

== cite ==
Added a citation within the article to a third-party
source. Can the two tags warning about citations be removed? One of them claims that there are no references or sources, which I have added to correct this issue.

I'll review this article within the next few days. [[User:Wizardman|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#030&quot;&gt;'''''Wizardman'''''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User:Wizardman/Operation Big Bear|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#600&quot;&gt;Operation Big Bear&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sub&gt; 17:26, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

Here are the concerns I found:
*&quot;which is comparable to over $76 million in 2009 $US&quot; We could probably use [[Template:Inflation]] for this. Not required, but might be helpful.
**'''Done''', I can take out the $US link if needed.[[User:Froggerlaura|Froggerlaura]] ([[User talk:Froggerlaura|talk]]) 22:54, 18 November 2010 (UTC)
*&quot;George Smith's father died within a year after moving to the city&quot; within a year of sounds better
**'''Done'''
*&quot;in Chicago but he eventually ran&quot; confusing wording; reword. Do you mean he just up and moved elsewhere? 
**'''Done''', he relocated to New York state within a couple of years because business was better there and &quot;less corrupt.&quot; Not sure how valid that last bit was.
*Nitpicking, but in the Cadmus' section, the numbers aren't really adding up. The horse had two wins yet you say he won money from the &quot;few victories&quot;. Keep them consistent. You also have him winning $200,000, when the numbers below don't quite add up to that.
**'''Done''', the press did not seem to know the exact value at the time and often quoted it as 200,000. I just tallied it to $195,000.
*&quot;1897 .&quot;space needs fixing
**fixed
*&quot;But Smith soon tired of the jockey's off-track antics,&quot; The but at the start probably isn't needed, reads better without it.
**fixed
*&quot;When James R. Keene asked Smith in late 1897 for permission to take Sloan to England to race in the Cambridgeshire Handicap, Smith did not refuse the offer.&quot; Saying that he accepted the offer sounds better. If he didn't really care either way though then this can be omitted, since that's what seems to be implied.
**'''Done''', he was pretty put-out with Sloan by that time.
*&quot;allowed James R. Keene to employee Willie Shaw for much of the season&quot; 'to employ' you mean?
**Whoops, fixed that.[[User:Froggerlaura|Froggerlaura]] ([[User talk:Froggerlaura|talk]]) 22:54, 18 November 2010 (UTC)

I'll put this on hold for seven days, and pass upon completion/fail upon nothing being done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Irwin Bazelon

Contemporary American composer Irwin Bazelon’s music is known for its interesting rhythms and its emphasis on the brass and percussion sections. In total, Bazelon composed nine symphonies and over sixty orchestral, chamber, and instrumental works. Some of his most famous works are Short Symphony, Churchill Downs, and Propulsions, which is written for 113 percussion instruments to be played by seven performers. Bazelon’s music lacks any regular pulse, instead it is characterized by unpredictable syncopation, irregular groupings, unexpected triplets, and off-beat accents. 

Irwin Bazelon was born in Evanston, Illinois on June 4, 1922. He was the elder of two sons born to Roy and Jeanette Bazelon. His grandparents emigrated from Russia to the US in the 1890s. Not much is known about his family before then. Early in his childhood, Bazelon contracted a case of scarlet fever that left him with a perforated eardrum and severe hearing loss in one ear. This caused introspection to the point that the composer described being cured as unleashing “the violent, silent world” inside. Bazelon’s very acute ear and sensitivity to sound also resulted from his early partial hearing loss. 

As a child, Bazelon was a gifted athlete. His father once hoped that he would have a career as a baseball player. As a child, the composer also played in a jazz band, which later served as a source of inspiration for many of his works such as Symphony No. 3 and Churchill Downs. When Bazelon was 17, he heard Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This was when the young Bazelon decided that he would pursue music and become a composer. In 1942, he transferred from his Northwestern University liberal arts course to study music at DePaul University.

At DePaul University, Bazelon studied composition with Leo Stein, who fostered Bazelon’s growth as a composer. Works from this time are juvenile, but show his rapid growth of compositional skills and his strong artistic vision. He graduated from DePaul with a Bachelor’s (1944) and Master’s (1945) in music. Bazelon continued on to Yale to study composition with Paul Hindemith. Unfortunately, Bazelon could not adapt to Hindermith’s teaching methods and in less than a year, moved to Oakland, Califormia to study with Darius Milhaud at Mills College. Bazelon credits Milhaud as having the greatest influence on the composer’s creative life. 

In 1948, the composer moved to New York City. There he supported himself by scoring documentaries, art films, and theatrical productions including two American Shakespeare Festival plays: The Taming of the Shrew and The Merry Wives of Windsor from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. In 1953, Bazelon also began to write music for commercials that ranged from Ipana toothpaste to Buitoni pasta. He is most famous for  the signature theme for the NBC news. In fact, Bazelon referred to himself as the “father of contemporary music in commercials”. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Bazelon refused to seek a permanent post at a university, he relied on his compositions.

Bazelon did serve as a guest conductor at schools such as Rutgers University, Eastman School of Music, Oberlin College, Rice University, and the University of Virginia. He conducted his music with orchestras such as the National Symphony and the Detroit Symphony. In 1975, Bazelon published Knowing the Score: Notes of Film Music, which marked the end of his commercial career. In 1983, Bazelon was awarded the Koussevitsky Prize for his contribution to contemporary music, which led to the growth of his international fame. 
His music rarely has easily recognizable melodies. When questioned regarding this, Bazelon stated, “My music is melodic, it is the melody of the 21st century”. Bazelon found inspiration from two main sources: city life and the racetrack.

The city of his birth, Chicago, and the city of much of his later life, New York, greatly influenced the composer. This is evident in the unpredictable rhythms and syncopation found in many of his works. Bazelon describes his music as having “the rebellious mutterings, cross-rhythms, and nervous tension and evergy of the city” and “the alerations of mood, color and dramatic flair are a direct expression of the constant changes of pace, the rhythmic beat of life in the big metropolis”. 

Bazelon described the racetrack and each horse race as capturing a wide range of human emotions ranging like “hope, anxiety, joy and disappointment”.  The composer was a long time horse-racing enthusiast. One of his most famous works, Churchill Downs, is named for the home of the Kentucky Derby. In fact, it can be said that the racetrack helped launch the composer’s symphonic career. With the money from a big win, Bazelone recorded Concert Ballet: Centauri 17 with 16 members of the New York Philharmonic. On a trip to Washington, D.C., the composer ran into Howard Mitchell, then the conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra. Bazelone played the recording for him and showed him the score for the Short Symphony. The tape led him to conduction his Short Symphony with the National Symphony Orchestra in 1962, his first major orchestral debut. 

Bazelon passed away on August 2, 1995, due to complications after heart surgery. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Interestingly enough, the hearse caught fire on the way to the cemetery on the expressway at the exit to the racetrack.</text>

==Just a thought==
I saw your edit of [[Bramins of Nepal]].  Funny how garbage that people put in gets deleted pretty fast huh?  Because people who seriously edit Wikipedia make every effort to be as accurate as possible, perhaps Wikipedia should be taken more seriously in the academic world.

'''''Citrobacter freundii''''' is a species of facultative. anaerobic. Gram-negative bacilli of the Enterobacteriaceae family.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/lab-bio/res/psds-ftss/citrobacter-eng.php&lt;/ref&gt; The bacteria are long rod-shaped with a typical length of 1-5 μm.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11269372&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|11269372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most ''C. freundii'' cells are surrounded by several flagella used for locomotion, but a few are not motile. It can be found in soil, water, sewage, food, and the intestinal tracts of animals and humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11269372&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|11269372}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Citrobacter'' genus was discovered in 1932 by Werkman and Gillen. Cultures of'' C. freundii'' were isolated and identified in the same year from soil extracts.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11269372&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|11269372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an opportunistic pathogen, ''C. freundii'' is responsible for a number of significant infections. It is known to be the cause of a number of nosocomial infections of the respiratory tract, urinary tract, blood, and many other normally sterile sites in patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17224563&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|17224563}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''C. freundii'' represents about 29% of all opportunistic infections.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17224563&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|17224563}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly, this infectious microbe in humans plays a positive role in the environment. ''C. freundii'' is responsible for reducing nitrate to nitrite in the environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8983520&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|8983520}}&lt;/ref&gt; This conversion is an important and crucial stage in the [[nitrogen cycle]]. These bacteria also help in recycling nitrogen.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8983520&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|8983520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''C. freundii'' has also been investigated for biodegradation of tannic acid used in tanneries.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid8983520&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|8983520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For metabolism, ''C. freundii'' has an ability to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon and energy source. Within its cell, a bacterial microcompartment can be found, which is capable of processing propanediol.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid21245529&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|21245529}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/98.116.30.26|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are some pages you might like to see:

* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

You are welcome to continue editing articles without [[Special:Userlogin|logging in]], but many editors recommend that you '''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} create an account]&lt;/span&gt;'''. Doing so is free, requires no personal information, and provides several benefits such as the ability to create articles. For a full outline and explanation of the benefits that come with creating an account, please see [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|this page]]. If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] (98.116.30.26) is used to identify you instead.

In any case, I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your comments]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your IP address (or username if you're logged in) and the date. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:XLinkBot|my talk page]], or ask your question and then place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Wikipedians looking for help|helpme]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the question on this page.

Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, your addition of one or more external links to the page [[:Low Water (band)]] has been reverted.&lt;br /&gt;Your edit [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=397136867&amp;oldid=333877788 here] was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove links which are discouraged per our [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] from Wikipedia.  The external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.  I removed the following link(s): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mdSOhOiqde0&lt;!-- matching the [[regex|regex rule]] \byoutube\.com) --&gt;. If the external link you inserted or changed was to a [[Wikipedia:Media|media]] file (e.g. a [[Wikipedia:Media help|sound or video]] file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's [[WP:COPYRIGHT|copyright policy]] and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our [[Wikipedia:Upload|upload]] facility to upload a suitable media file.&lt;br /&gt;If you were trying to insert an [[Wikipedia:External links|external link]] that does comply with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]] and [[Wikipedia:List of guidelines|guidelines]], then please accept my creator's apologies and feel free to [[WP:UNDO|undo]] the bot's revert.  However, if the link does not comply with our policies and guidelines, but your edit included other, constructive, changes to the article, feel free to make those changes again without re-adding the link.  Please read Wikipedia's [[WP:EL|external links guideline]] for more information, and consult my [[User:XLinkBot/Reversion reasons|list of frequently-reverted sites]]. For more information about me, see [[User:XLinkBot/FAQ|my FAQ page]]. Thanks! --[[User:XLinkBot|XLinkBot]] ([[User talk:XLinkBot|talk]]) 17:28, 16 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;If this is a shared [[IP address]], and you didn't make the edit, please ignore this notice.&lt;/small&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nota Bene is one of the very few fully-featured word processors still in existence, of the many that started life in the 1980s. As such, it seems to me that it has a legitimate place on Wikipedia.

I admit to being an NB user, but I am not trying to promote the product, but rather to document its existence. I don't think I'm saying anything about it that isn't said, at greater length, in the Wikipedia articles about MS Word and Word Perfect--the article on the latter contains a number of statements such as 'its unusually user-friendly macro/scripting language'.

I would be grateful for guidance on this issue.

I am replying to the above three paragraphs. I take note that you are an apparent novice in editing Wikipedia. I am slightly more advanced in understanding the need to sign posts here by typing four tildes, and the importance of sourcing material. The welcoming and civil environment of Wikipedia recognizes that we were all novices at some point and no one is harshly condemned. We just make corrections and move on.

This article has almost no notes. I am left pondering the astonishing irony that in an article about a word processor whose appeal is entirely to scholars who footnote &lt;i&gt;everything,&lt;/i&gt; like sprinkles on a donut, there are almost no notes here. While some may contest the characterization of Nota Bene's &quot;clunky&quot; user interface, the pressing need here is for sourcing. This is not a place for a software review; rather, look at reviews of Nota Bene along with documentation. Then synthesize and summarize what you garner from these sources, with notes and appropriately linked cross-references. If I were fluent in Wiki-ese, I would provide the accepted terminology and links to documentation that describes approaches to writing and sourcing an article of this sort.[[User:Waltezell|Waltezell]] ([[User talk:Waltezell|talk]]) 23:35, 4 September 2011 (UTC)</text>

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Pablo604, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia!  I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Sam web]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:
* [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|Starting an article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Biographies of living persons]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]] or ask me on my talk page. &lt;!-- Template:First article --&gt; Again, welcome!&amp;nbsp;- [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:29, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Sam web]]==
[[Image:Stop hand.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]

Please do not make statements attacking people or groups of people.  Wikipedia has a strict policy against [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks|personal attacks]]. [[Wikipedia:Attack_page|Attack pages]] and images '''are not tolerated''' by Wikipedia and are [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|speedily deleted]]. Users who continue to create or repost such pages and images in violation of our [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|biographies of living persons]] policy will be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked]] from editing Wikipedia. Thank you. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Sam web|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Sam web|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-attack-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:29, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Ndstacy, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Ndstacy|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[URL Radio]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:
* [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|Starting an article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Biographies of living persons]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]] or ask me on my talk page. &lt;!-- Template:First article --&gt; Again, welcome!&amp;nbsp;- [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:30, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:URL Radio]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:URL Radio]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:URL Radio|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:URL Radio|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:30, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Akhildude121, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Akhildude121|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Akhil-Anu]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]] or ask me on my talk page. &lt;!-- Template:First article --&gt; Again, welcome!&amp;nbsp;[[User:Daemonic Kangaroo|Daemonic Kangaroo]] ([[User talk:Daemonic Kangaroo|talk]]) 17:30, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Akhil-Anu]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Akhil-Anu]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Akhil-Anu|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Akhil-Anu|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Daemonic Kangaroo|Daemonic Kangaroo]] ([[User talk:Daemonic Kangaroo|talk]]) 17:30, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Oklahoma Lake''' is located in north east [[Oklahoma City]] in the Canadian river valley and borders the [[North Canadian River]] by Westminster Road. The surface area is around 60 acres with a 1/2 acre island and the shoreline is primarily sand. The lake is fed from ground water and the water is usually calm because of the low elevation. The primary fish species are crappie, bass, and channel catfish. Oklahoma Lake activities include swimming, camping, picnics, fishing, and jet-ski sports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oklake.org&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporter incident===
Djurgården were involved in an incident at [[Swedbank Stadion]], in a match against [[Malmö FF]], on 30 July 2011. The match was abandoned after eleven minutes, with Malmö FF at that time leading 1–0. The minute before, Djurgårdens IF forward [[Daniel Sjölund]] was given a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]. Six fireworks were launched, forcing referee Martin Hansson to abandon the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fotboll.expressen.se/allsvenskan/1.2513970/nya-laktarskandalen-mff-dif-avbrots |title=Nya läktarskandalen - MFF-Dif avbröts |publisher=''[[Expressen]]'' |author=Sigge Dabrowski |language=Swedish |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/match/?scr=result&amp;fmid=1594867 |title=Matchinformation: Malmö FF - Djurgården |publisher=[[Swedish Football Association]] |language=Swedish |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Canal+, one of the fireworks was close to hitting a photographer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/malmoff/article13398251.ab |title=Ny läktarskandal – matchen avbruten |publisher=''[[Aftonbladet]]'' |author=Patrik Sjögren |language=Swedish |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were different opinions as to where the fireworks came from: Canal+ believed that the fireworks came from the section above the Djurgården terrace while the police believed that the fireworks came from within the Djurgården section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/djurgarden/article13398422.ab |title=Polisen: Allt kommer från Djurgårdens sida |publisher=''[[Aftonbladet]]'' |author=Patrik Sjögren |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swedish Discipline Committee [[chairman]] Khennet Thallinger stated that they &quot;want to preserve the due process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/allsvenskan/fotbolldirekt-nyhet/?cid=33576&amp;archiveId=68 |title=Disciplinnämnden fattar beslut om två veckor |publisher=[[Swedish Football Association]] |language=Swedish |date=2011-07-30 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 September 2011, the Committee decided that the game would be replayed from [[kick-off (association football)|kick-off]]. The Committee explained that the evidence saying Djurgården were responsible for the firecrackers was not considered strong enough to blame them. As such, neither Djurgården nor Malmö were fined any sums of money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://svenskfotboll.se/svensk-fotboll/tavling/namnder-och-kommitteer/disciplinnamnden/arkiv/tavling/disciplinnamnden/2011/beslut-i-svffs-disciplinnamnd-5-september-2011/ |title=Beslut i SvFF:s Disciplinnämnd 5 september 2011 |publisher=[[Swedish Football Association]] |author=Erika Zaar |language=Swedish |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/sportbladet/fotboll/sverige/allsvenskan/djurgarden/article13577867.ab |title=Domen: Matchen ska spelas om |publisher=''[[Aftonbladet]]'' |author=Patrik Sjögren |language=Swedish |date=2011-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SFA's Competition Committee decided that the rematch would be played on 15 October 2011.

A tag has been placed on '''[[:User:Indyatweets]]''', requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article seems to be unambiguous advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item 11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of '''[[:User:Indyatweets]]''' and leave a note on '''[[{{TALKPAGENAMEE:User:Indyatweets}}|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citations]] from independent [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] to ensure that the article will be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn --&gt;  [[User:Mean as custard|Mean as custard]] ([[User talk:Mean as custard|talk]]) 17:31, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Stop_x_nuvola.svg|left|35px|alt=|link=]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 105%;&quot;&gt;Your account has been '''blocked indefinitely''' from editing Wikipedia because it appears to be mainly intended or used for publicity and/or promotional purposes. Please read the following carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Why can't I edit Wikipedia?'''&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Special:MyContributions|Your account's edits]] and/or username indicate that it is being used on behalf of a company, group, celebrity or other well-known individual, or organization for purposes of promotion and/or publicity. The edits may have violated one or more of our rules on spamming, which include: [[WP:LINKSPAM|adding inappropriate external links]], [[WP:SPAM|posting advertisements]], and [[WP:PROMOTION|using Wikipedia for promotion]]. Wikipedia has many articles on companies, groups, and organizations, but it is considered inappropriate for such groups to use Wikipedia to write about themselves. ''In addition'', usernames like yours are disallowed under our [[WP:ORGNAME|username policy]].

;Am I allowed to make these edits if I change my username?
Probably not.  See [[WP:FAQ/Organization]] for a helpful list of frequently asked questions by people in your position. Also, review the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest guidance]] to see the kinds of limitations you would have to obey if you did want to continue editing about your company, group, or organization. If this does not fit in with your goals, then you will not be allowed to edit again. Consider using [[WP:OUT|one of the many websites]] that allow this instead.

;What can I do now?
You are still welcome to write about something other than your company or organization. If you ''do'' intend to make useful contributions on some other topic, you must convince a [[WP:ADMIN|Wikipedia administrator]] that you mean it. To that end, please do the following:

*Add the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-spamun|Your proposed new username|Your reason here}} on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your proposed new username&quot; with a new username you are willing to use. See [[Special:Listusers]] to search for available usernames. Your new username will need to meet our [[WP:U|username policy]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your reason here&quot; with your reason to be unblocked. In this reason, you must:
:*Convince us that you understand the reason for your block and that you will not repeat the edits for which you were blocked.
:*Describe in general terms the contributions that you intend to make if you are unblocked.

If you believe this block was made in error, please see how to [[WP:AAB|appeal a block]]. &lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;[[User:Tnxman307|TN]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;&lt;big&gt;[[User talk:Tnxman307|X]]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Tnxman307|Man]]&lt;/font&gt; 18:39, 16 November 2010 (UTC)&lt;/div&gt;[[Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names|{{PAGENAME}}]]{{z17}}&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spamublock --&gt;</text>

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:The Feast]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:The Feast]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:The Feast|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:The Feast|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:33, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Irwin Bazelon&lt;br /&gt;

Contemporary American composer Irwin Bazelon’s music is known for its interesting rhythms and its emphasis on the brass and percussion sections. In total, Bazelon composed nine symphonies and over sixty orchestral, chamber, and instrumental works. Some of his most famous works are Short Symphony, Churchill Downs, and Propulsions, which is written for 113 percussion instruments to be played by seven performers. Bazelon’s music lacks any regular pulse, instead it is characterized by unpredictable syncopation, irregular groupings, unexpected triplets, and off-beat accents. &lt;br /&gt;

Irwin Bazelon was born in Evanston, Illinois on June 4, 1922. He was the elder of two sons born to Roy and Jeanette Bazelon. His grandparents emigrated from Russia to the US in the 1890s. Not much is known about his family before then. Early in his childhood, Bazelon contracted a case of scarlet fever that left him with a perforated eardrum and severe hearing loss in one ear. This caused introspection to the point that the composer described being cured as unleashing “the violent, silent world” inside. Bazelon’s very acute ear and sensitivity to sound also resulted from his early partial hearing loss. &lt;br /&gt;

As a child, Bazelon was a gifted athlete. His father once hoped that he would have a career as a baseball player. As a child, the composer also played in a jazz band, which later served as a source of inspiration for many of his works such as Symphony No. 3 and Churchill Downs. When Bazelon was 17, he heard Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. This was when the young Bazelon decided that he would pursue music and become a composer. In 1942, he transferred from his Northwestern University liberal arts course to study music at DePaul University.&lt;br /&gt;

At DePaul University, Bazelon studied composition with Leo Stein, who fostered Bazelon’s growth as a composer. Works from this time are juvenile, but show his rapid growth of compositional skills and his strong artistic vision. He graduated from DePaul with a Bachelor’s (1944) and Master’s (1945) in music. Bazelon continued on to Yale to study composition with Paul Hindemith. Unfortunately, Bazelon could not adapt to Hindermith’s teaching methods and in less than a year, moved to Oakland, Califormia to study with Darius Milhaud at Mills College. Bazelon credits Milhaud as having the greatest influence on the composer’s creative life. 
:&lt;br /&gt;

In 1948, the composer moved to New York City. There he supported himself by scoring documentaries, art films, and theatrical productions including two American Shakespeare Festival plays: The Taming of the Shrew and The Merry Wives of Windsor from the mid-1950s to the mid-1970s. In 1953, Bazelon also began to write music for commercials that ranged from Ipana toothpaste to Buitoni pasta. He is most famous for  the signature theme for the NBC news. In fact, Bazelon referred to himself as the “father of contemporary music in commercials”. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Bazelon refused to seek a permanent post at a university, he relied on his compositions.
&lt;br /&gt;

Bazelon did serve as a guest conductor at schools such as Rutgers University, Eastman School of Music, Oberlin College, Rice University, and the University of Virginia. He conducted his music with orchestras such as the National Symphony and the Detroit Symphony. In 1975, Bazelon published Knowing the Score: Notes of Film Music, which marked the end of his commercial career. In 1983, Bazelon was awarded the Koussevitsky Prize for his contribution to contemporary music, which led to the growth of his international fame. 
His music rarely has easily recognizable melodies. When questioned regarding this, Bazelon stated, “My music is melodic, it is the melody of the 21st century”. Bazelon found inspiration from two main sources: city life and the racetrack.
:&lt;br /&gt;

The city of his birth, Chicago, and the city of much of his later life, New York, greatly influenced the composer. This is evident in the unpredictable rhythms and syncopation found in many of his works. Bazelon describes his music as having “the rebellious mutterings, cross-rhythms, and nervous tension and evergy of the city” and “the alerations of mood, color and dramatic flair are a direct expression of the constant changes of pace, the rhythmic beat of life in the big metropolis”. &lt;br /&gt;
Bazelon described the racetrack and each horse race as capturing a wide range of human emotions ranging like “hope, anxiety, joy and disappointment”.  The composer was a long time horse-racing enthusiast. One of his most famous works, Churchill Downs, is named for the home of the Kentucky Derby. In fact, it can be said that the racetrack helped launch the composer’s symphonic career. With the money from a big win, Bazelone recorded Concert Ballet: Centauri 17 with 16 members of the New York Philharmonic. On a trip to Washington, D.C., the composer ran into Howard Mitchell, then the conductor of the National Symphony Orchestra. Bazelone played the recording for him and showed him the score for the Short Symphony. The tape led him to conduction his Short Symphony with the National Symphony Orchestra in 1962, his first major orchestral debut.

Bazelon passed away on August 2, 1995, due to complications after heart surgery. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery. Interestingly enough, the hearse caught fire on the way to the cemetery on the expressway at the exit to the racetrack.</text>

*'''Delete''' - Interesting stuff, but fails [[WP:BAND]] and [[WP:GNG]].  Also appears to be a copyvio of [http://www.synnack.com/about.php].  I've tagged the article for speedy deletion because of the copyvio.

A tag has been placed on '''[[:User:RascalCompany/Rascal Company]]''', requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article seems to be unambiguous advertising that only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion#G11|the general criteria for speedy deletion]], particularly item 11, as well as [[WP:SPAM|the guidelines on spam]]. 

If you can indicate why the subject of this article is not blatant advertising, you may contest the tagging. To do this, please add &lt;code&gt;{{tl|hangon}}&lt;/code&gt; on the top of '''[[:User:RascalCompany/Rascal Company]]''' and leave a note on '''[[{{TALKPAGENAMEE:User:RascalCompany/Rascal Company}}|the article's talk page]]''' explaining your position. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would help make it encyclopedic, as well as adding any [[Wikipedia:Citing sources|citations]] from independent [[Wikipedia:Reliable sources|reliable sources]] to ensure that the article will be [[Wikipedia:Verifiability|verifiable]]. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.[[Category:User talk pages with Spam-warn notices||{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;!-- Template:Spam-warn --&gt;  [[User:Mean as custard|Mean as custard]] ([[User talk:Mean as custard|talk]]) 17:33, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Stop_x_nuvola.svg|left|35px|alt=|link=]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 105%;&quot;&gt;Your account has been '''blocked indefinitely''' from editing Wikipedia because it appears to be mainly intended or used for publicity and/or promotional purposes. Please read the following carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Why can't I edit Wikipedia?'''&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Special:MyContributions|Your account's edits]] and/or username indicate that it is being used on behalf of a company, group, celebrity or other well-known individual, or organization for purposes of promotion and/or publicity. The edits may have violated one or more of our rules on spamming, which include: [[WP:LINKSPAM|adding inappropriate external links]], [[WP:SPAM|posting advertisements]], and [[WP:PROMOTION|using Wikipedia for promotion]]. Wikipedia has many articles on companies, groups, and organizations, but it is considered inappropriate for such groups to use Wikipedia to write about themselves. ''In addition'', usernames like yours are disallowed under our [[WP:ORGNAME|username policy]].

;Am I allowed to make these edits if I change my username?
Probably not.  See [[WP:FAQ/Organization]] for a helpful list of frequently asked questions by people in your position. Also, review the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest guidance]] to see the kinds of limitations you would have to obey if you did want to continue editing about your company, group, or organization. If this does not fit in with your goals, then you will not be allowed to edit again. Consider using [[WP:OUT|one of the many websites]] that allow this instead.

;What can I do now?
You are still welcome to write about something other than your company or organization. If you ''do'' intend to make useful contributions on some other topic, you must convince a [[WP:ADMIN|Wikipedia administrator]] that you mean it. To that end, please do the following:

*Add the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-spamun|Your proposed new username|Your reason here}} on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your proposed new username&quot; with a new username you are willing to use. See [[Special:Listusers]] to search for available usernames. Your new username will need to meet our [[WP:U|username policy]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your reason here&quot; with your reason to be unblocked. In this reason, you must:
:*Convince us that you understand the reason for your block and that you will not repeat the edits for which you were blocked.
:*Describe in general terms the contributions that you intend to make if you are unblocked.

If you believe this block was made in error, please see how to [[WP:AAB|appeal a block]].

[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia.

* Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia.

* ClueBot NG produces very few [[false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG/B|report it here]], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again.

== Army Equipment ==
Infantry Equipment

*Small arms and Support weapons 
**Lee-Enfield .303 Rifle - The standard weapon of the infantry.
**Springfield .300 rifle - Stocks of this weapon were received from the US in 1940 and were distributed to the LDF for use. Main problem with this weapon was a lack of ammunition for the type.
**Vickers .303 Medium MG - The standard heavy machine gun of the battalions.

*Light MG's: 
**Lewis .303 - An aging weapon which became difficult to maintain but which constituted the main light MG for the army. 
**Hotchkiss .303 - Another older weapon described as obsolescent but which had to be used for lack of suitable replacement. 
**Bren .303 - The modern and favored weapon, of which only small numbers could be obtained. 

*Mortars 
**Brandt 81mm - The standard battalion mortar until 1943, which gave the battalions a semblance of mortar support. 
**3&quot; mortar - A stock of these weapons doubled the battalions mortar support but still left it some what deficient in numbers. 

**Boyes 0.55&quot; Anti tank rifle - This large calibre weapon constituted the armies only anti armour weapon in any numbers, a weapon which was useless against all but light armour. 

*Artillery 
**18 Pounder 
**3.7 Inch 
**4.5 Inch 
**75mm

A tag has been placed on [[:Alex Howe]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Alex Howe|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Alex Howe|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:34, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

[[File:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute to Wikipedia, at least one of [[Special:Contributions/123.231.93.34|your recent edits]], such as the one you made to [[:Jaffna]], did not appear to be constructive and has been [[Help:Reverting|reverted]] or removed. Please use [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|the sandbox]] for any test edits you would like to make, and read the [[Wikipedia:Welcoming committee/Welcome to Wikipedia|welcome page]] to learn more about contributing constructively to this encyclopedia. The reverted edit can be found &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=397137879 here]&lt;/span&gt;.

[[Image:Information.svg|left|25px|alt=|link=]] Please refrain from making unconstructive edits to Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Jaffna]]. Your edits appear to constitute [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalism]] and have been '''automatically''' [[Help:Reverting|reverted]].
* If you would like to experiment, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. Note that human editors do monitor recent changes to Wikipedia articles, and [[WP:ADMINS|administrators]] have the ability to [[WP:BLOCK|block]] users from editing if they repeatedly engage in [[WP:vandalism|vandalism]].
* ClueBot NG produces very few [[false positives]], but it does happen. If you believe the change you made should not have been detected as unconstructive, please [[User:ClueBot NG/B|report it here]], remove this warning from your talk page, and then make the edit again. 
* The following is the log entry regarding this warning: [[Jaffna]] was [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jaffna&amp;diff=397138852&amp;oldid=397138773 changed] by [[Special:Contributions/123.231.93.34|123.231.93.34]] [[User:123.231.93.34|(u)]] [[User talk:123.231.93.34|(t)]] ANN scored at 0.867742 on 2010-11-16T17:38:41+00:00 &lt;!-- MySQL ID: 37143 --&gt;.

== Welcome ==
'''Welcome!'''

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/123.231.93.34|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are some pages you might like to see:

* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]] and [[Wikipedia:Article development|How to develop articles]]
* [[Wikipedia:Your first article|How to create your first article]] (using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] if you wish)
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

You are welcome to continue editing articles without [[Special:Userlogin|logging in]], but many editors recommend that you '''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} create an account]&lt;/span&gt;'''. Doing so is free, requires no personal information, and provides several benefits such as the ability to create articles. For a full outline and explanation of the benefits that come with creating an account, please see [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|this page]]. If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] (123.231.93.34) is used to identify you instead.

In any case, I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your comments]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your IP address (or username if you're logged in) and the date. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:Pharaoh of the Wizards|my talk page]], or ask your question and then place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Wikipedians looking for help|helpme]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the question on this page. Again, welcome! &lt;!-- Template:welcome-anon --&gt;

[[File:Nuvola apps important.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] Please stop your disruptive editing. If you continue to [[Wikipedia:Vandalism|vandalize]] Wikipedia, as you did at [[:Jaffna]], you may be [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|blocked from editing]]. &lt;!-- Template:uw-vandalism3 --&gt; [[User:Mlpearc|&lt;span style='font-family:;color:#800020'&gt;'''Mlpearc'''&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;small&gt;[[User_talk:Mlpearc|&lt;span style='font-family:;color:#CFB53B'&gt;'''powwow'''&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:44, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

'''HNLMS Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden''' (Dutch: ''Zr.Ms. Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'') was an [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] ''ramtorenschip''&lt;ref name=k1877&gt;Koloniaal verslag van 1877, Bijlage C [5.10], p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; ([[turret ship|turret ram ship]]) built in Great Britain for the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] in the mid-1860s. She was transferred to the [[Dutch East Indies]] in 1876 and participated in the [[Dutch intervention in Lombok and Karangasem]] in 1894. The ship was [[hulk (ship)|hulk]]ed in 1899 and [[ship breaking|scrapped]] in 1925.

==Design and description==
[[File:NL Prinz Hendrik.jpg|Right elevation drawing, the shaded areas illustrate her armor scheme|thumb|left]]
HNLMS ''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' was ordered from [[Cammell Laird|Laird &amp; Son Co.]] by the [[Royal Netherlands Navy]] as an enlarged version of the {{sclass|Scorpion|ironclad|6}} turret ships originally ordered by the [[Confederate States Navy]].&lt;ref name=d9&gt;Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[gun turret]]s was normally rotated by two men via a system of gears; 20 seconds were required for a full 360° rotation if a full crew of 19 men was used. The ship's bow was reinforced to act as a [[Naval ram|ram]] and a hurricane deck connected the [[forecastle]] and [[poop deck]]s. For sea passages the ship's [[freeboard (nautical)|freeboard]] could be increased to {{convert|14|ft|1}} by use of hinged [[wikt:bulwark|bulwarks]] {{convert|5|ft|1}} high.&lt;ref name=d0/&gt;

The ship had an [[length between perpendiculars]] of {{convert|230|ft|m|1}}, a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|44|ft|m|1}}, and a [[draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|18|ft|8|in|m}}. She displaced {{convert|3375|t|LT}}. The iron hull was divided by five watertight [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s and the ship had a [[double bottom]] beneath the [[engine room|engine]] and [[Boiler room (ship)|boiler rooms]]. Her crew consisted of 230 officers and men.&lt;ref name=d90&gt;Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, pp. 199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propulsion===
''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' had two [[Marine steam engine#Back acting|horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engines]],&lt;ref name=s0&gt;Silverstone, p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; built by Lairds, each driving a single {{convert|15|ft|6|in|m|1|adj=on}} propeller.&lt;ref name=d0/&gt; The engines were powered by four square [[boiler (steam generator)|boiler]]s.&lt;ref name=s0/&gt; The engines produced a total of {{convert|2426|ihp|lk=in}} which gave the ship a maximum speed of {{convert|12.09|kn|lk=in}} during her [[sea trial]]s. She carried {{convert|380|LT|t}} of coal and was [[barque]]-rigged with three masts. Her fore and mainmasts were supported by tripods to reduce interference with the firing arcs of the gun turrets by the ship's [[rigging]]. ''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' had a total sail area of {{convert|1554|sqm|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=d0&gt;Dutch Ironclads Prins Hendrik and Konig der Nederlanden, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armament===
The ship mounted a pair of [[Armstrong Whitworth|Armstrong]] {{convert|9|in|adj=on|0}} [[rifled muzzle loader|rifled muzzle-loading guns]] in each gun turret. Each gun weighed {{convert|12.5|LT|t}}. Two {{convert|120|mm|1|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Krupp]] [[breech-loading gun]]s were fitted in the forecastle and another pair in the poop as [[chase gun]]s. Six {{convert|37|mm|in|adj=on|sp=us}} [[Hotchkiss gun|Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns]] were added shortly after completion.&lt;ref name=d9/&gt; They fired a shell weighing about {{convert|1.1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} at a muzzle velocity of about {{convert|2000|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} to a range about {{convert|3500|yd|m}}. They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNUS_1pounder_m1.htm|title=United States of America 1-pdr (0.45 kg) 1.46&quot; (37 mm) Marks 1 through 15|date=15 August 2008|accessdate=22 December 2009|publisher=Navweps.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armor===
''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' had a complete waterline [[Belt armor|belt]] of [[wrought iron]] that was {{convert|4.5|in|mm|0}} thick. Amidships, for a length of {{convert|120|ft|m|1}}, the armor belt had a height of {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} of which {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} below the [[waterline]]. At the bow and stern the belt was only {{convert|2.5|ft|m|1}} high above the waterline. 4.5-inch transverse [[bulkhead (partition)|bulkhead]]s were provided to protect the bases of the turrets and the machinery spaces from [[raking fire]]. Each turret was protected by {{convert|5.5|in|0|adj=on}} armor plates, although the total thickness around the [[Glossary of nautical terms#G|gun ports]] was {{convert|11|in|0}}. The deck was unarmored.&lt;ref name=d0/&gt;

==Service==
''Prins Hendrik der Nederlanden'' was laid down by [[Cammell Laird|Laird &amp; Son Co.]] at [[Birkenhead]] in August 1865.

The '''Vuelta a Bolivia''' is the most important [[road bicycle race]] in the State of Bolivia. The first edition of the race, in 2008, replaced an historical Bolivian race, the &quot;Doble Copacabana de Ciclismo&quot;. It is now organized as a [[2.2]] event on the [[UCI America Tour]].

'''''The Conflagration''''' ({{lang-de|Der rote Hahn}}, 1901) is a German play written by [[Gerhart Hauptmann]] (1862–1946). Like [[Henrik Ibsen]], Hauptmann focuses attention on social issues. Unlike ''[[The Weavers (play)|The Weavers]]'' (1892) and ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' (1893), it does not seem to have ever been performed on Broadway;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=5892&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was  adapted as a German film in 1962, directed by [[John Olden]] and starring [[Rudolf Platte]] as Schuhmachermeister Fielitz and [[Inge Meysel]] as Frau Fielitz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385199/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Setting: In the neighbourhood of [[Berlin]], around 1901.

Fielitz, a cobbler, is arguing with his wife, who wants them to stop toiling for nothing. She suggests committing arson, setting fire to their house to obtain insurance money. Von Wehrhahn arrives, Mrs. Fielitz being formerly known as Wolff and his housekeeper. Neighbors arrive as well: Langheinrich, a smith, and Rauchhaupt, a retired constable. They make comments about the iron cross inscribed by Rauchhaupt on the grave of her former husband. Later, Langheinrich receives the visit of Dr Boxer, who has returned after being at sea for several years. Gustav, Rauchhaupt's mentally handicapped son, enters briskly, excited, making sounds from his mouth seeming like a trumpet. He drops a box of matches. There is a fire at the Fielitz house, Langheinrich being called as a voluntary fireman. The business is investigated by Wehrhahn, who concludes, contrary to his father's belief, that Gustav is guilty and must be sent away. Despite Rauchhaupt's suspicions, the Fielitz are never found out. They profit by it, together with their family, including their prosperous son-in-law to their daughter, Schmarowski, an architect. Nevertheless, the stress of the experience seems to have affected Fielitz' brain, Mrs Fielitz feels poorly, and just as Fielitz bursts in the room exclaiming: &quot;Me ... me ... me ... me ... it was me that did it!&quot;, his wife wanders, her arms thrashing about, and dies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Christopher Sower''' (27 January 1754 in [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown, Pennsylvania]] – 3 July 1799 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]) was a [[Printer (publishing)|printer]] and [[publisher]] in [[Pennsylvania]].

==Biography==
He was the son of [[Christopher Sower (younger)|Christopher Sower the younger]] and the grandson of [[Christopher Sower (elder)|Christopher Sower the elder]]. He developed a strong distaste for those who criticized the German sectarians&lt;ref group=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;[[Quakers]], [[Mennonites]], [[Schwenkfelders]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]] and the [[Dunker]] sect of his father. See {{Cite DAB|title=Sower, Christopher (September 1721 - August 26, 1784)|year=1935|author=George Harvey Genzmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their beliefs.  These critics included [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Henry Melchior Muhlenberg]] and [[John Henry Miller]].  With his preferences, Sower was naturally of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]] sympathies before and during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dab&quot;&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Sower, Christopher (January 27, 1754 - July 3, 1799)|year=1935|author=James O. Knauss}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received his father's Germantown home and printing and publishing operations in 1774 when they were handed over to him without legal formality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite DAB|title=Sower, Christopher (September 1721 - August 26, 1784)|year=1935|author=George Harvey Genzmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then began publishing a newspaper, ''Germantowner Zeitung'', which had a loyalist tone so far as the authorities allowed. When the British occupied [[Philadelphia]] in 1777, he moved there.  During this time he was wounded and captured by rebel troops; he was released by exchange a short time later. He accompanied the British to [[New York City]] in 1778 when they abandoned Philadelphia.  That year the family belongings were confiscated and sold by the rebels.&lt;ref name=&quot;dab&quot;/&gt;

After [[Siege of Yorktown|Corwallis's defeat]], Sower went to [[England]] from [[New York]] and received an indemnification for his losses.  In 1785 he went to [[New Brunswick]] where he was deputy postmaster and king's printer.  He died in the Baltimore house of his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;dab&quot;/&gt;

'''Birse Civils''' is a civil engineering company based in [[North Yorkshire]], England. It was formerly a separate civil engineering company simply known as Birse Group, but is now owned by [[Balfour Beatty]].

==History==
The company was founded as the Birse Group in 1970. It was based in [[Doncaster]].

In February 2002, it separated its building (houses), civil engineering, rail, underground and process divisions into Birse Build, Birse CL, Birse Rail, Birse Metro and Birse Process.

===Acquisition===
In June 2006, it was bought by Balfour Beatty for £32 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.balfourbeatty.com/bby/media/press/2006/2006-06-26/ Balfour Beatty]&lt;/ref&gt;
Birse Build was integrated into Balfour Beatty's Mansell company.

The remaining Birse companies continued to function as independent OPCO's under the Balfour Beatty flag.

==Structure==
* Birse Group Services is in [[Barton on Humber]]
* Birse Coastal is in Preston, Lancashire. Offices closed in 2011, transferred to Cheadle.
* Birse Nuclear is in [[Cheadle Hulme]]

==Products==
Buildings it has built include:
* B &amp; Q's headquarters in Chandlers Ford
* The BBC's headquarters in Leeds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/leeds/citylife/construction_bbc_update.shtml BBC Leeds]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Walkers Stadium]] in [[Leicester]] (Birse Construction), at a cost of £35 million
* [[Huntington Stadium]], a rugby league ground in York
* The [[Reebok Stadium]] in Bolton

&lt;!-- REQUIRED --&gt;
|Article= Fire It Up (EP)
|Use=Infobox
&lt;!-- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED --&gt;
|Source=The cover art can or could be obtained from Continuum Records
&lt;!-- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION --&gt;
|Name= Fire It Up (EP)

|Label= Continuum Records, Top Dog Records

&lt;!-- OVERRIDE FIELDS --&gt;
|Description= This is the cover art for the extended play album Fire It Up by the artist Kid Rock. The cover art copyright is believed to belong to the label, Continuum Records, or the graphic artist. It was previously deleted from wikipedia because the Fire It Up article was deleted and it turned into an &quot;orphan image.&quot;
|Portion= The entire cover: because the image is cover art, a form of product packaging, the entire image is needed to identify the product, properly convey the meaning and branding intended, and avoid tarnishing or misrepresenting the image.
|Low_resolution= The copy is of sufficient resolution for commentary and identification but lower resolution than the original cover. Copies made from it will be of inferior quality, unsuitable as artwork on pirate versions or other uses that would compete with the commercial purpose of the original artwork.
|Purpose= The image is used for identification in the context of critical commentary of the work for which it serves as cover art. It makes a significant contribution to the user's understanding of the article, which could not practically be conveyed by words alone. The image is placed in the infobox at the top of the article discussing the work, to show the primary visual image associated with the work, and to help the user quickly identify the work and know they have found what they are looking for. Use for this purpose does not compete with the purposes of the original artwork, namely the artist's providing graphic design services to music concerns and in turn marketing music to the public.
|Replaceability= As musical cover art, the image is not replaceable by free content; any other image that shows the packaging of the music would also be copyrighted, and any version that is not true to the original would be inadequate for identification or commentary.
|other_information= Use of the cover art in the article complies with Wikipedia non-free content policy and fair use under United States copyright law as described above.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Alvaro VIII''' (Mvemba a Mpanzu), of the [[House of Kinlaza]], was king of the [[Kingdom of Congo]], from 1666 to 1669.

==Biography==
Alvaro VIII was elevated to the throne by Paulo da Silva, Count of [[Soyo]], which marched on [[M'banza-Kongo|São Salvador]] and killed his predecessor, [[Álvaro VII of Kongo|King Alvaro VII]].

In 1667, he sent his ambassador, Anastasius, to [[Luanda]] ([[Angola]]), to negotiate a treaty that ceded to the Portugueses the right to exploit the mines of Congo, located in the provinces of [[Mbamba]] and [[Mpemba]]. Theodosius, Duke of Mbamba, bowed to the king's decision, but Peter, Duke of Mbemba, refused.

Leading a small army, Peter attacked Mbamba, killed Theodosius and then invaded the kingdom's capital, [[M'banza-Kongo|São Salvador]], killing Alvaro VIII and proclaimed himself king under the name of [[Pedro III of Kongo|Peter III]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Roger Holloway''' [[OBE]] (24 November 1933 – 31 October 2010) had many occupations during a colourful life, including: soldier, big game hunter, international wine and spirit merchant and [[Anglican]] priest. He was the youngest of six children of a civil servant. His family had a military tradition. 

He was brought up in [[Blackheath, London|Blackheath]] and educated at [[Eastbourne College]]. For his [[National Service]] he was a [[platoon commander]] in [[Kenya]] during the emergency. After that he was assistant to a professional big game hunter.

He then went up to [[Selwyn College, Cambridge]] to read [[Theology]] with a view to [[ordination]]. However he had difficulties with his faith at that time and joined [[Pfizer]] as a salesman and brand manager. In 1960 he moved to the advertising agency Robert Sharp and Partners running the Players and [[Unilever]] accounts. In 1963 went into the wine business of Charington United Breweries Group (later Bass Charrington). He then moved to [[Jardine Matheson]] where, from 1982 to 1988 he was managing director of wines and spirits.This was one of the most profitable divisions of Jardine Matheson with the majority of its revenues being derived from sales to Japan. Roger Holloway, lived in Japan for some years and was the manager who developed this excellent division for Jardine's.

Meanwhile he had been ordained priest in 1981, as a protégé of [[Robert Runcie]]. He served as a &quot;worker-priest&quot; at St. John's Cathedral in [[Hong Kong]], the Anglican church in [[Tokyo]] and at [[CIA]] and [[NSA]] facilities in Asia. These roles fitted in with his business travel.

In 1988 he settled in London and became a full-time priest at [[St Margaret's, Westminster]] and also appeals director of the [[Imperial Cancer Research Fund]] and Director of the [[Industrial Christian Fellowship]]. In 1997 he was elected Preacher to [[Gray's Inn]], continuing until his death. Also in 1997 he was appointed [[OBE]] &quot;for services to the whisky industry&quot;. With this description, [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] was surprised to see him in clerical dress!

He married in 1962, Anne Alsop, who survives him with three sons and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/religion-obituaries/8135407/The-Reverend-Roger-Holloway.html Obituary], [[The Daily Telegraph]], 16 Nov 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bynum Mound and Village Site''' ([[Smithsonian trinomial|22CS501]]) is a [[Woodland period#Middle Woodland period (1–500 CE)|Middle Woodland period]] [[archaeological site]] located near [[Houston, Mississippi|Houston]] in [[Chickasaw County, Mississippi]]. The complex of six [[burial mounds]] was in use during the Miller 1 and Miller 2 phases of the [[Miller culture]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/natr/pharr_mounds-bear_creek/sec4-1.htm|title=Pharr Mounds-Ceramic analysis|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2010-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ENCYCPREHIST/&gt; and was built between 100 BCE and 100 CE. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989 as part of the [[Natchez Trace Parkway]] at milepost 232.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot;/&gt;

==Site description==
The {{convert|6|ha}} site is located on a low ridge which overlooks [[Houlka Creek]] in the [[Tombigbee River]] drainage area.&lt;ref name=ENCYCPREHIST&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Prehistory|volume=6 : North America|edition=1|article=Middle Eastern Woodland|page=331|editor1-first=Peter Neal|editor1-last=Peregrine|editor1-link=Peter N.

In the 1940s, archaeologists with the [[National Park Service]] excavated five of the mounds. The two largest mounds were restored afterward and the site is open to the public and now includes informational plaques. Excavations produced artifacts made from non local materials such as [[Greenstone (archaeology)|Greenstone]], copper, and [[galena]], and distinctive projectile points that did not originate at the site or even in Mississippi. Similar high prestige exotic goods were also found at [[Pharr Mounds]], a nearby contemporaneous site, which show the local peoples involvement with the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell exchange system]], long distance trade network and religious network.&lt;ref name=BYNUM-NPS/&gt;

===Mound A===
During excavations of Mound A archaeologists found the remains of a woman who had been placed between two parallel burned oak logs buried at the base of the mound. They also found ornamental copper spools at each of her wrists. They also found the remains of two adult males and a child.&lt;ref name=BYNUM-NPS/&gt;

===Mound B===
The largest mound at the site, Mound B, was found to be covering a log lined crematory pit. Archaeologists found twenty nine polished greenstone [[Celt (tool)|celts]] arranged in an L-shaped pattern. They also found human remains, some cremated and others unburned, on the ash-covered floor of the pit. Exotic artifacts including copper [[ear-spool]]s, nineteen [[chert]] projectile points believed to have been imported from Hopewell peoples in [[Illinois]], and a piece of galena were also found.&lt;ref name=BYNUM-NPS/&gt;

==Arbcom election questions from [[User:Rschen7754|Rschen7754]]==
Due to the changed format of this year's election questioning, I have removed all the questions that are covered by the general election questions (but please be sure to answer those thoroughly!) If you wouldn't mind answering the following brief questions that evaluate areas not covered by the general questions, that would be great!

# What are your views on a) [[WP:COMPETENCE]]  b) [[WP:NOTTHERAPY]]?
#:'''A.''' Both essays make valid and valuable points, but the principles underlying them need to be applied in a sensitive and humane fashion. [[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] ([[User talk:Newyorkbrad|talk]]) 02:19, 20 November 2010 (UTC)
# Do a group of editors focusing on a specific style guideline or convention have the ability and/or right to impose on other groups of editors their particular interpretation of the style guideline, or their own standardized convention, even if there is significant opposition?
#:'''A.''' It depends on the nature of the guideline or convention. There are some issues as to which it is acceptable for styles and conventions to be non-uniform throughout Wikipedia. An example is the choice between American English and British or Commonwealth English; if we took a poll and 60% or even 80% of editors favored one of the two varieties, this would not be a good basis for proscribing use of the other. On the other hand, there are some issues where consistency of style is important and it may be more important that an issue be settled rather than to leave it under discussion indefinitely and allow it to become a time-sink and a distraction. As the old saying goes, it is fine to have everyone drive on the left, and it is fine to have everyone drive on the right; but to allow some people to drive on the left while others drive on the right is a very bad idea.
#:In any event, though, the Arbitration Committee would generally wade into issues such as this only in cases of prolonged disputation and tension (the Date delinking case is one example). We aspire to a Wikipedia on which at some point, editors whose views are in the minority accept that consensus is against them and accept that consensus, unless there are significant reasons not to.

==Questions from Lar==

;Note to readers: 
:This is a copy of [[User:Lar/ACE2010/Questions]]. These questions were taken from [[User:Lar/ACE2009/Questions|last year]] and [[Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2008/Candidate_statements/Questions/General#Questions_from_Lar|the year before]] and modified to fit changes in circumstance. 

;Notes to respondents:
:* In some cases I am asking about things that are outside ArbCom's remit to do anything about. I am interested in your thoughts even so. 
:* Note also that in many cases I ask a multi part question with a certain phrasing, and with a certain ordering/structure for a reason, and if you answer a 6 part question with a single generalized essay that doesn't actually ''cover'' all the points, I (and others) may not consider that you actually answered the question very well at all. 
:* It is also Not Helpful to answer &quot;yes, yes, no, yes&quot; (because you are expecting people to count on their fingers which answers go with which questions...) go ahead and intersperse your answers. We'll know it was you. No need to sign each part unless you want us to know which parts you answered when.
:* For those of you that ran last year (or the year before, etc.), feel free to cut and paste a previous year's answers if you still feel the same way, but some of the questions have changed a bit or expanded so watch out for that.
:* Where a question overlaps one of the [[Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee Elections December 2010/Questions|standard questions]] I have tried to note that and explain what elaboration is desired.

;The questions

#Is the English Wikipedia's current BLP approach correct in all aspects? Why or why not? If not, what needs changing? In particular, how do you feel about the following suggestions:
#: a) &quot;Opt Out&quot; - Marginally notable individuals can opt out, or opt in, at their request. If it's a tossup, the individual's wishes prevail, either way. George W. Bush clearly does not get to opt ''out'', too notable. I (Lar) clearly do not get to opt ''in'', not notable enough.
#: b) &quot;Default to Delete&quot; - If a BLP AfD or DRv discussion ends up as &quot;no consensus&quot; the default is to delete. A clear consensus to KEEP is required, else the article is removed.
#: c) &quot;Liberal semi protection&quot; - The notion that if a BLP is subject to persistent vandalism from anons it should get semi protection for a long time (see [[User:Lar/Liberal Semi]] ... we were handing out 3 months on the first occurance and 1 year for repeats)
#: d) &quot;[[WP:Flagged Protection]]&quot; - a trial, which ended up being called [[WP:Pending changes]] instead. Please comment on the trial results as they specifically relate to the BLP problem. (there is another question about revisions generally) Would you do anything different in the actual implementation?
#: e) &quot;[[WP:Flagged Revisions]]&quot; - the actual real deal, which would (presumably) be liberally applied.
#::'''A.''' I've been concerned about Wikipedia's approach to [[WP:BLP|biographies of living persons]] almost since I became an editor. In the past four years, the written BLP policy and its implementation have improved in a number of respects. There is still ample room for further progress, though.
#::As I've discussed both on-wiki and elsewhere, what is sometimes referred to as &quot;BLP&quot; or &quot;the BLP issue&quot; actually involves a whole series of related issues. One is the insertion of outright falsehood and defamation into articles, either as prankish vandalism or as a form of harassment. Second is the creation of articles with undue negative weight for political, ideological, financial or similar reasons. Third is the existence of articles with no or insufficient references for controversial propositions, or at all, making it impossible to verify whether the article content is accurate (&quot;no unsourced negative information&quot; is probably the core of the BLP policy, though it shouldn't be thought of as all of it). Fourth, and an aspect that I have focused a great deal of attention on personally, is the effect that Wikipedia articles may have on the privacy of article subjects: even a statement that is reliably sourced and undisputedly true may nonetheless not belong on Wikipedia, simply because its inclusion is likely to significantly harm the subject of the article, without much if any encyclopedic purpose.
#::I can't possibly say everything here that I have to say about these BLP issues. I've written about them on-wiki several times over the years (my first substantive contributions were probably the February 2007 Brian Peppers DRV, the &quot;lost laptop&quot; AfD and DRV and AfD again, [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Doc glasgow#Outside view by Newyorkbrad]], [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/QZ Deletion dispute#Outside view by Newyorkbrad]], and the Hornbeck-Ownby deletion discussion (please see the DRV log for May 28, 2007; I don't seem to be able to link directly to the discussion). I've continued to speak up on these issues from time to time, not only on-wiki, but also elsewhere. When I guest-blogged last year about Wikipedia on one of the leading law-and-politics blogs, [[The Volokh Conspiracy]] (link to the whole series of posts [http://volokh.com/posts/chain_1242098183.shtml here]), three of my posts were about &quot;Wikipedia, the Internet, and Diminished Privacy&quot; and &quot;Wikipedia and the Biography Problem&quot; (parts 1 and 2). Those interested not only in my own views on BLP but the history of the issue on-wiki (as of last year, at least) might want to take a look at those. A few months later, when I was graciously invited to give one of the keynote speeches at the 2009 Wikiconference New York, I chose BLP as the topic of my address. A link to the speech is [http://www.archive.org/details/nywikiconf_newyorkbrad_26july2009 here] (Ogg Theora player required; speech begins about 8 minutes into the video). I plan to give a similar talk at Wikimania next year and to continue promoting high standards in this area.
#::I think there is an increasing recognition that while the near-universality of the Internet, by no means limited to Wikipedia, has improved many people's lives in a number of ways, it has had a serious and to some people devastating impact on others'. In the ''Badlydrawnjeff'' arbitration case (decided the year before I came onto the committee), the arbitrators resolved that Wikipedia articles should not be used so as to continue the victimization of subjects whose notability arises primarily from their having been victimized by the acts of others. (At that stage, whether we could probably consider the well-being of an article subject at all in making a content or deletion decision seemed to be controversial; we seem to have arrived at a consensus that the answer to that one is yes, though there will always be disputes about specific instances.) I have arrived at the very depressing conclusion, though, that while it is critically important for Wikipedia to uphold high standards for inclusion of articles dealing with, for example, the subjects of &quot;Internet memes&quot; that disrupt their lives and the otherwise non-notable victims of crimes, Wikipedia's ability to change the world is limited because so much publicity is on the wider Internet and outside our ability to control. Even such a seemingly unambiguous advance for access to information as the increasing online availability of old newspapers can have a major impact on the life of someone who is mentioned in an unflattering way in an old article&amp;mdash;a fact that journalists are just starting to think about ([http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/14/opinion/14pubed.html?scp=4&amp;sq=4-year-old%20journalism&amp;st=cse this column] by the Public Editor of ''The New York Times'' about coverage of a recent court decision involving a 4-year-old defendant contains a recent and interesting discussion). A similar issue is the permanence of revelations and allegations made on social media, as discussed by Jeffrey Rosen in his well-written and memorably titled Sunday Times Magazine cover story  [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/25/magazine/25privacy-t2.html &quot;The Web Means the End of Forgetting&quot;], which is an excellent analysis, though it messes up some details about Wikipedia itself. (Nor are these new issues; they were raised, though to a lesser extent, by other media long before the Internet and Wikipedia came along, as witnessed by the Sidis and Haynes cases that I discussed in my speech.) Another related phenomenon is that court filings in litigation are now published online immediately in many jurisdictions, although many litigations relate to intensely private matters and even though, by definition, in most cases, not everything that both sides claim in a litigation can be true.
#::Isaac Asimov predicted in 1956 in &quot;[[The Dead Past]]&quot; that advanced technology would devastate individual privacy, although he didn't anticipate the specific form of technology, and I fear that that has come to pass. The fact that Wikipedia, wittingly or unwittingly, plays a part in this is the single most upsetting thing to me about this project that I have come to care so much about. With Wikipedia long since having become a top-ten website, with the realization that a Wikipedia article on any individual will almost invariably become one of the top (if not ''the'' top) Google hits on the subject, and with complaints from article subjects coming into OTRS every day, it is of imperative public importance that we continue to be sensitive to the impact that Wikipedia articles have on their subjects' lives.
#::Turning from the general to the specific, I don't think that a universal &quot;opt-in/opt-out&quot; regime would be practicable, but I do favor taking an article subject's preference into account in borderline situations. (I have wondered before, and would be interested in seeing the statistics, whether we receive more complaints by the subjects of articles who want them deleted or corrected, or by the former subjects of deleted articles who want them reinstated. What I have heard suggests the latter, but I'd like to know for sure.) &quot;Default to delete&quot; for BLPs seems a sensible idea, but is controversial because many deletion rationales are not directly related to core BLP issues; at a minimum, &quot;default to delete&quot; needs to be made policy where the article subject's notability is borderline and the article treats the subject in a primarily negative way or where the subject has requested deletion. Liberal semiprotection for BLPs that are the subject of vandalism clearly makes sense and should be implemented in many cases (one downside is the possibility that trolls would intentionally vandalize merely to trigger the semiprotection; another is that we want our highest-profile articles to be editable, so there would be a temptation to exempt the BLPs of the most highly notable figures&amp;mdash;but then again, we've had [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] semi'd for years, and this is still a wiki). The principles discussed in [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Sarah Palin protection wheel war]], in which I wrote the decision, are relevant here (although the &quot;BLP special protection&quot; regime that is cross-referenced in that case has not really taken hold). I'll discuss flagged revisions in response to another of your questions below.
#::One additional form of protection for BLP subjects that has gained some footing in the past couple of years is the exclusion of many Wikipedia-space (and other non-article-space) pages from indexing by Google and other search engines. For a long time, we might decide to delete an article because the subject was non-notable, only to have ''the AfD discussion itself'' (full of comments such as &quot;Delete. This person hasn't accomplished anything.&quot;) come up as the top Google hit on the subject's name. We've done a reasonable job at installing the &quot;robots.txt&quot; or &quot;NOINDEX&quot; parameters on pages such as XfD, the noticeboards, the arbitration pages, the BLP noticeboard, and the like to reduce the incidence of Wikipedia metadiscussion showing up as key search results. I was part of a move to expand the use of NOINDEX a couple of years ago, for the benefit of both article subjects and contributors. I don't know that we've finished the job in this area; if anyone knows of a listing of all the pages that are supposed to be NOINDEXed, and all the pages that currently are, I'd be interested in seeing it.
#::If there are any follow-up questions, please let me know.
#Given that it is said that the English Wikipedia ArbCom does not set policy, only enforce the community's will, and that ArbCom does not decide content questions:
#: a) Is question 1 a question of content or of policy?
#::'''A.''' Some of both. 
#: b) ArbCom in the past has taken some actions with respect to BLP that some viewed as mandating policy. Do you agree or disagree? Did they go far enough? Too far? Just right?
#::'''A.''' The ''Badlydrawnjeff'' decision (2007, before I was an arbitrator) I thought was thoughtful, well-worded, and necessary at that moment in time; the ''Footnoted quotes'' decision (2008, during my period of absence that I'll be discussing elsewhere) was well-intentioned and I remember thinking from the sidelines that I would have voted for it, but the &quot;special BLP enforcement regime&quot; created by the decision seems not to have become part of the culture of the site; the ''Sarah Palin protection wheel war case'' (September 2008; I wrote this one) had a good set of principles, though it is one of those situations where looking back one wonders whether the incident that triggered the case really warranted a six-week arbitration; the unsourced-BLP-deletion motion in January was a measured response to an unusual situation, but I would have waited a little longer before the committee took any action, as there was ongoing and very productive community discussion taking place in a variety of forums at the time. If I've overlooked any other BLP-relevant decisions you wanted me to comment on, please let me know.
#:c) If you answered question 1 to the effect that you did not agree in every respect with the BLP approach, how would you go about changing the approach? Take your answers to 2a and 2b into account.
#::'''A.''' This is an area where good and thoughtful practice is worth ten thousand rules. There is no substitute for a high degree of sensitivity on the part of our editors. One overriding principle is that if the existence of a Wikipedia article on a person is likely to cause him or her real-world damage or distress, we ought to be pretty darn sure that the article has a good deal of encyclopedic importance before creating or keeping it.
#:
#It has been said that the English Wikipedia has outgrown itself, that the consensus based approach doesn't scale this big. Do you agree or disagree, and why? If you agree, what should be done about it? Can the project be moved to a different model (other wikis, for example, use much more explicit voting mechanisms)? Should it be? Consider the controversy around some election provisions... we had an RfC on the topic early this year, but by the election we still didn't have closure on some open questions. Does the recent adoption of Secure Poll for some uses change your answer?
#::'''A.''' I agree with the statement that &quot;the consensus based approach doesn't scale this big,&quot; that is, with respect to decisions that are made with input across the entire project. That being said, relatively few decisions are made across the entire project; for 99% of decisions to be made, the decision-makers are a few editors working on an article or a few editors interested in a policy page or perhaps a few dozen editors drawn in by a controversy or an ANI discussion. It is only on the decisions that garner input from hundreds of editors that consensus in the classic sense becomes hard to obtain and harder to evaluate. I don't have any particular solutions to offer to this problem; suggestions that we go to more of a pure voting model (outside the context of elections like this one and a few similar instances), that the Arbitration Committee take on more of a leadership role, or that a new leadership body within the project be created, all suffer from various drawbacks that have already been widely discussed. One observation I would add, though, is that as the number of participants offering pro or con views in a discussion increases, the more likely the discussion is to take on the reality if not the appearance of voting, because as the number of participants increases it becames exponentially more difficult for a decision-maker to divine a result in a holistic fashion rather than by merely counting heads. 
#:
#Please discuss your personal views on Sighted/Flagged revisions/Pending Changes. What did you think of the trial? Should we ultimately implement some form of this? What form? Do you think the community has irretrievably failed to come to a decision about this? Why? What is the role, if any, of ArbCom in this matter? What is the reason or reasons for the delay in implementing? 
#::'''A.''' I have very mixed views on this whole issue. Unfortunately, the trial seemed in some ways to have petered out without providing as many editors as we'd hoped with interaction with the new system that might help them to gauge its acceptability. I almost had the sense that the community's energy on this issue was used up for awhile in the long debates about whether we should have a new system and how it should be configured and what articles it should apply to and how long the trial should be&amp;mdash;and then there was a much lesser focus to the nitty-gritty of how the new interface affected the editing experience for both new and experienced editors, and whether (to the extent one could tell form the limited sample) it helped to reduce the problems it was designed to reduce. A serious concern was that only a few administrators seemed to get heavily involved in the trial; from the numbers I've heard about, I think that one administrator (my arbitrator colleague Risker) may have been as responsible for adding articles to the FR list as everyone else put together. 
#::The pros and cons of FR remain what they always were, including on the pro side the opportunity to screen out blatant defamation and nonsense and some assurance of quality control; on the con side the possibility that vandalism will just become sneakier (no reviewer can spot everything, or even nearly anything, beyond the blatant) and the potential that hourslong delays in approving proposed edits will turn off would-be new editors. I honestly don't know what the next step is here, in the absence of a governance process that we all stand behind. I do not anticipate that the Arbitration Committee will have a role in making this decision.
#:
#Wikipedia was founded on the principle that anonymity, or at least pseudonymity, is OK. You do not need to disclose your real identity, if you do not wish to, to edit here. You are not forbidden from doing so if you wish.
#:a) Do you support this principle? Why or why not?
#::'''A.''' I support this approach both as a matter of principle and as a matter of practicality, and feel strongly that our current approach is correct. 
#:b) If you do not support it, is there a way to change it at this late date? How? Should it be (even if you do not support it, you may think it should not be changed)?
#::'''A.''' Not applicable, as I think the current policy that permits each editor to make this choice is appropriate. 
#:c) With anonymity comes outing. Lately there has been some controversy about what is outing and what is not... if someone has previously disclosed their real identity and now wishes to change that decision, how far should the project go to honor that? Should oversight be used? Deletion? Editing away data? Nothing?
#::'''A.''' Reasonable steps should be taken as appropriate to the specific case. Deleting old versions of a userpage is a relatively easy step; renaming of course is possible where desired; revdeleting or oversighting should generally be reserved for situations where they are proportionate, such as where the editor is being subjected to serious acts of harassment, or where the editor is a minor. A related situation in which we should be liberal in accommodating requests, because no actual data is being lost, is where an editor created his or her account as User:JohnSmith (but with a much less common name than &quot;John Smith&quot;) and now realizes with consternation that his or her first three hundred Google hits are random posts on Wikipedia talkpages.
#:d) If someone has their real identity disclosed elsewhere in a way that clearly correlates to their Wikipedia identity, is it outing to report or reveal that link? Why or why not?
#::'''A.''' It is usually inappropriate to make such a link on-wiki unless it is known that the user in question does not object. I can imagine exceptions, but they would be rare. In general, where an editor believes that the identify of a psedonymous editor raises an issue and knows that the identification should not be posted on-wiki, the Arbitration Committee should be consulted. This most frequently arises in alleged conflict-of-interest situations; as we have noted in several decisions (this was originally Fred Bauder's formulation), the policies discouraging conflicts of interest and permitting anonymous editing create a tension that of necessity is imperfectly resolved. We attempted to refine this somewhat this past year in the ''Gibraltar'' case, but didn't get as far as I might have liked.
#:e) Do you openly acknowledge your real identity? Should all Arbitrators openly acknowledge their real identity? Why or why not? If you are currently pseudonymous, do you plan to disclose it if elected? (this is somewhat different than [[Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2008/Candidate_statements/Questions/General#Questions_from_Thatcher|Thatcher's 1C from 2008]] in that it's more extensive)
#::'''A.''' At this time, it's widely known that my real name is Ira Brad Matetsky and that I'm a lawyer in New York. (I'll have some related thoughts in one of my responses on the main questions page.) I don't think any arbitrator, or anyone else, should be required to disclose his or her identity. I don't think I'm any different as an arbitrator because my name has become public, and I'm not sure that anyone else would be either, but we would probably lose some people who at least want to make an effort to keep this information private. 
#:f) Does the WMF make it clear enough that pseudonymity is a goal but not a guarantee? What should the WMF be doing, in your opinion, if anything, about loss of pseudonymity? What should ArbCom be doing, in your opinion, if anything, about loss of pseudonymity?
#::'''A.''' I think Risker's essay on this subject should be required reading for anyone seeking advanced permissions. I'm not sure that there is much more the Foundation could do besides publicize facts such as those mentioned in the essay. (Do you have a suggestion?) The Arbitration Committee can, and does, sanction editors who reveal identifying information about other editors without permission. 
#:g) If an editor clearly and deliberately outs someone who does not wish to be outed, what is the appropriate sanction, if any? Does the question differ if the outing occurs on wiki vs off-wiki? (this is somewhat similar but different from [[Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2008/Candidate_statements/Questions/General#Questions_from_Thatcher|Thatcher's 1D from 2008]])
#::'''A.''' We have banned people for intentionally revealing identifying information about other editors, particularly where it is obvious that the purpose is malicious, and I expect we will continue to do. This is so even where the information is posted on other publicly visible websites. A lesser sanction might be in order if the outing occurred inadvertently, or in a borderline case (there are instances in which it is an &quot;open secret&quot; among some group who an editor is in real life, and someone doesn't realize that the information hasn't been released on Wikipedia itself). 
#:
#Stalking is a problem, both in real life and in the Wikipedia context. 
#:a) Should the WMF be highlighting (disclaiming) the possible hazards of editing a high visibility website such as Wikipedia? Should some other body do so?
#:b) What responsibility, if any, does WMF have to try to prevent real life stalking? What aid, if any, should the WMF give to someone victimised. Balance your answer against the provisions of the privacy policy.
#:c) If someone has previously been stalked in real life, what allowances or special provisions should be made, if any?
#:d) What special provisions should be made, if any, to deal with stalkers who are using Wikipedia to harass victims? Consider the case where the stalkee is a real life person and the harassment is done by manipulating their article, as well as the case where the stalkee is an editor here.
#:e) Where is the line between stalking or harassing an editor and reviewing the contributions of a problematic editor to see if there are other problems not yet revealed?
#:f) Are there editors who ''overplay the stalking card''? What's to be done about that?
#::'''A.''' The question correctly posits that &quot;stalking, both in real life and in the Wikipedia context,&quot; is a serious problem (obviously, an order of magnitude more serious if it has off-wiki overtones than if it just involves fiddling with someone's edits). The good news is that significant stalking and off-wiki harassment incidents originating from Wikipedia are relatively rare; the bad news is that when they do occur, some of them have been gravely serious (including several that the Arbitration Committee has had to discuss confidentially). An editor facing any form of harassment is entitled to full support from the rest of the community, including the Arbitration Committee where the committee is able to help in any way, although there is always a judgment to be made about how much publicity one gives to a given situation (as sometimes publicity is exactly what the harasser is seeking, and there is always a fear of copycat incidents). In a given case, appropriate steps to protect a harassed editor might include oversighting or rev-deleting harassing posts appearing on-wiki, protecting or closely watching a given page, imposing sanctions against the harasser, and in an appropriate case facilitating contact with the Office if the Office is in a position to provide advice about further measures.
#::With regard to subquestion (e), again, it's a case-by-case call, but to a certain extent we have to rely on what we can tell about motive, and it is also important to see whether the review of an editor's contributions is motivated by a genuine and significant problem, as opposed to a trumped-up or exaggerated one. With regard to subquestion (f), in a number of arbitration cases we have cautioned that exaggerated, overly quick, or (sadly in one case) delusional allegations of harassment or stalking are not acceptable; it's a serious charge, and needs to be backed up by serious evidence before it is made.
#::I don't know that the problem presently rises to the level where an &quot;editing Wikipedia may make you a target of disgruntled people&quot; disclaimer ought to appear on the bottom of the edit box, but I do think it's a good idea to advise new users (as we do to some extent) to consider the possibility when they choose a username or decide how much personal information to provide on their user page. In the special case of editors who are minors, especially younger minors, cautioning these editors not to give out identifying information was one of the reasons I drafted the page [[Wikipedia:Guidance for younger editors]]; some of the advice there about the information that is out there about everyone on the Internet these days applies equally to us older editors as well. 
#:
#A certain editor has been characterized as &quot;remarkably unwelcome&quot; here, and the &quot;revert all edits&quot; principle has been invoked, to remove all their edits when discovered. In the case of very unwelcome and problematic editors, do you support that?  What about for more run of the mill problem editors? What about in the case of someone making a large number of good edits merely to test this principle? Do you think blanket unreverting removed edits is appropriate or would you suggest that each edit be replaced with a specific summary standing behind it, or some other variant?
#::'''A.''' I don't regard the individual you are referring to as an &quot;editor&quot;; he is a dangerously mentally ill criminal and stalker (physical stalker, not &quot;wikistalker&quot;) and should be treated as such. My personal view is that the Foundation should have obtained a court order years ago barring him from editing on any project. Needless to say, this individual reflects an extreme situation (some of you reading this will know who and what I am talking about, and unfortunately I shouldn't tell the rest of you). For more routinely banned editors, I think common sense needs to be used: if a banned editor sees &quot;teh&quot; and fixes it to &quot;the&quot;, I don't feel any obligation to change it back again. 
#:
#What is the appropriate role of outside criticism:
#:a) Should all discussion of Wikipedia remain ON Wikipedia, or is it acceptable that some occur off Wikipedia?
#::'''A.''' I think most discussion by Wikipedians is best conducted on the site, but it's certainly acceptable for editors to comment elsewhere as well. I've referenced this in decisions I've written for the committee, such as [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/C68-FM-SV#Participation in other websites|here]].
#:b) Do you have a blog or other vehicle for making outside comments about Wikipedia? If so what is the link, or why do you choose not to disclose it? Why do you have (or not have) such an individual vehicle?
#::'''A.''' I don't have my own blog. The closest I've come to this is the week of guest-blogger posts about Wikipedia I wrote last year on [[The Volokh Conspiracy]], which I've linked to above.
#:c) Please state your opinion of Wikipedia Review and of the notion of participating there. Describe your ideal outside criticism site, (if any)?
#::'''A.''' I was asked this question during the 2007 election. Part of my answer then was this:
#:::Wikipedia Review is a forum of varying quality, just as one would anticipate given the wide variety of people who contribute to it. From time to time, WR has offered reasonable, or at least arguable, criticism of Wikipedia and its editors. Other times, some of WR's content has been seriously off-target and misguided, containing too many threads replete with factual errors coupled with hatred, anger, and vitriol. One of the reasons WR is so uneven is that its contributors include both individuals who acknowledge Wikipedia's role while seeking to improve specific aspects of our policies or performance, but also include others who are outright hostile to the existence of Wikipedia and would support doing virtually anything to promote our destruction. [I then went on to suggest that WR would enhance its credibility if some of its participants discontinued the practice of exposing identifying information about Wikipedia contributors.]
#::Three years later, and after some participation in WR of my own, my answer would still be about the same. There is some valuable content on Wikipedia Review, and some criticism of us that I respect but disagree with, and then there is a certain amount of what can only be described as hatred and lashing out and at times craziness. I do give WR credit for helping to identify some aspects of the BLP problem facing Wikipedia before everyone here fully appreciated them. (Of the ten people who have written most eloquently about Wikipedia-related BLP issues in my experience, two are current or former WR moderators, and another three are Wikipedia administrators who also post on WR.) It is a shame that useful and important WR threads on issues such as this are sometimes drowned out by what I shall simply describe, without further adjectives, as some of the other content on the site.  
#:d) Do you think it appropriate or inappropriate for an editor to participate in an outside criticism site? For an admin? For an Arbitrator? Why or why not (in each case)?
#::'''A.''' As reflected in my own occasional participation in WR, I don't have an issue with anyone's participating in a criticism site. Although other sites have their own policies about their content, I would hope that such participation would be constructive and would not be consistent with the overall values that we expect from Wikipedia contributors.
#:e) Do you have an account at an outside criticism site? If it is not obvious already, will you be disclosing it if elected? Conversely, is it acceptable to have an anonymous or pseudonymous account at such a site? Why or why not? Assuming an arbitrator has one, some folk may try to discover and &quot;out&quot; it. Is that something that should be sanctioned on wiki? (that is, is it actually a form of outing as addressed in question 5?)
#::'''A.''' I have an account on Wikipedia Review, under the same username of Newyorkbrad. I will add that I was as surprised as anyone when I first found myself with such an account; I had never intended to register there, although beginning around mid 2007 I did monitor the discussion on the publicly available portions of the site. What happened was that a banned user who was referenced in an arbitration decision I wrote e-mailed me and opined that it was unfair that I could not hear his side of the story because he was banned, and I responded that I'd be glad to hear account elsewhere, and the next thing I knew he signed me up for a WR account (I remember an e-mail from one of the WR moderators quizically wondering if their new member was actually me). I lurked on the site for awhile, and then I started posting (and thereby hangs a tale, which I'll be covering in one of the individual questions on my other page). Since then I've chimed in in WR discussions from time to time&amp;mdash;sometimes to offer information, sometimes to give my opinion on an issue, sometimes just in banter&amp;mdash;although my participation has tailed off in the past year or so, for a variety of reasons, one of which is that I've said much of what I have to say there, and also because there are a few members of the site who seem to be hostile to me and other Wikipedia &quot;functionaries&quot; whenever we post on the site. (Not to speak for them, but I think they see a danger that there is a tipping point at which their criticism site would become an annex to Wikipedia discussion, rather than a true criticism site.)
#:f) How has this (the view of outside criticism) changed in the last year? Has it changed for the better or for the worse?
#::'''A.''' About the same.
#:
#Does the English Wikipedia have a problem with [[meatball:VestedContributor|vested contributors]]? Why or why not? What is to be done about it (if there is a problem)?
#::'''A.''' I don't find the ''term'' &quot;vested contributors&quot; to be a particularly useful one, partly because its meaning is opaque at first glance, but as I have stated in another answer, experienced editors, including administrators, should be expected ''at least'' to comply with the same behavioral standards that we expect from other users, and ideally to set an enhanced example of good behavior on-wiki. I've noted this more than once in arbitration decisions I've written; see for example [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/C68-FM-SV#Consistent standards]] (that's principle 13 of the decision, and principles 17 and 18 are also relevant).
#:
#Does the English Wikipedia have a problem with [[WP:FACTION|factionalism]]? Why or why not? What is to be done about it (if there is a problem)?
#::'''A.''' &lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;I think there is one group of editors who believe there is a problem with factionalism, and another group of editors who strongly believe there is no such problem, and the two are constantly at odds with each other.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/small&gt; First of all, for someone reading here who doesn't click the links, it should be noted that [[WP:FACTION]] is a redirect to [[Wikipedia:Tag team]]. I haven't encountered that shortcut before coming to this question set, and had expected the link to be to an essay about nationalist and similar disputes or something of that nature, rather than this. As for tag-teaming, I think it is a problem in some instances, but as the essay points out, it often is quite possible that two or more editors have the same views regarding an issue of article content or policy, and I think that is much more common than tag-teaming of a problematic nature. I think much of the guidance offered in this essay for identifying this problem and dealing with it when it occurs seems reasonable.

Followups

These are both related to the CC case

#What was the point of the principle about factionalism that was passed if you didn't then use it for anything?
#:'''A.''' It's good to see such attention to detail about the wording of a case; I know that when I draft a decision on my own, I do my best to ensure that there is correspondence between the principles and the findings and the remedies. The correspondence may be a little less direct when we have a decision written (literally) by a committee, as this one was (paragraphs of the final decision were drafted by seven different arbitrators, and the order in which arbitrators voted does not necessarily correspond to which was which). I assume that by &quot;the principle about factionalism,&quot; you are referring to principle 4, &quot;Collective behavior of blocs of editors.&quot; This principle should be read in conjunction with principles 5 and 21, &quot;Wikipedia is not a battleground&quot; and &quot;Battlefield conduct,&quot; and with the next few paragraphs after no. 5. The findings of fact contain some reference to factionalism as impairing the editing in the Climate change topic area (finding 1.1, last sentence), and finding 2 is also relevant (and see my comment on it on the proposed decision talkpage, which I thought a statement of the indisputable, but which drew heavy criticism from both sides). Regarding the findings and remedies regarding individual editors, which are always the main &quot;takeaway&quot; from a case for many people no matter how elegant the principles and background findings might be, we found that a dozen editors had chronically engaged in &quot;battlefield conduct&quot; or conduct reflecting a &quot;battleground mentality&quot; (see [[WP:BATTLE]]). Remedies were then adopted with respect to each of these editors. Although &quot;battlefield editing&quot; might not be the precise phrase I might have chosen if I'd written every word of the decision, it is a descriptive one, and directly ties in to the factionalization of some editors in the topic area. Therefore, I don't see the basis for your premise that we didn't follow up on the principle regarding factionalism. In fact, that &quot;factionalism&quot; and &quot;battleground&quot; are two sides of the same coin is inherent in your own proposals on the workshop, where you cited &quot;factionalism&quot; to &quot;WP:BATTLEGROUND.&quot; To the extent your proposed findings and remedies grouped a number of editors together as part of a &quot;faction&quot; and sought to sanction them on that basis, I found the wording we used in the decision preferable.
#What was the point of asking what everyone's concerns were and then ignoring the input, even when asked what you planned to do with it?
#:'''A.''' At the outset of the case, as is true with many cases, the precise scope of the case was unclear. The main one of the three requests for arbitration that were consolidated into the case (which as I indicated in my response to another question, didn't work out well) was particularly broad. Therefore, it occurred to me that we might get useful input by asking the parties and other interested editors what issues they might like to see addressed. Unfortunately, the list of potential questions we received was even broader and more diffuse than the original case itself. The various parties posted a total of one hundred forty-five such questions, many of which were clearly not suitable for resolution by the ArbCom, and others of which were worded unhelpfully. It therefore was manifestly not practicable to respond to the questions by answering each one of them directly, or anything like that. Still, I did carefully review them and I believe that other arbitrators did as well. A great number of the suggested questions were indeed addressed during the case, either in the decision itself, or in arbitrator comments on the proposed decision.

== Questions/comments from Ncmvocalist and responses from Newyorkbrad ==

If it's not inconvenient for you, I'd like it if you could respond directly under each question/comment. Thank you in advance. [[User:Ncmvocalist|Ncmvocalist]] ([[User talk:Ncmvocalist|talk]])

;OWC
Q1. ''The mailing list existed for arbitrators to discuss matters which are sensitive or private. For example, if an user had to say something which could not be revealed in public, the only way to convey it is through (what should be) private &amp; secure off-wiki communication ('OWC'). However, there have been several occasions where there is no specific 'need' for arbs to use OWC to discuss comments/votes amongst each other (in fact, such comments/votes could have been made on-wiki).'' Which parts of this statement are incorrect (if any) and why? [[User:Ncmvocalist|Ncmvocalist]] ([[User talk:Ncmvocalist|talk]]) 20:02, 16 November 2010 (UTC)
:'''A.''' The mailing list is used for several purposes, including addressing matters that need to be kept confidential, but also for internal coordination and discussion among the arbitrators. The nature of the committee's work is such that not every comment needs to be posted on-wiki, where it will become part of the eternal record of one of the world's top five websites. That being said, the basis for the committee's decision-making needs to be clear on-wiki (except in the rare case where confidentiality or similar considerations supervene). I think the arbitrators are agreed upon this. I have never seen an example of back-channel &quot;deal-making&quot; among arbitrators or ''quid pro quos'' or anything of that nature, for example. Looking back, I can think of a couple of instances where the Arbitration Committee's intent to do something could and should have been announced on-wiki earlier in the decision-making process than it was, but I can't think of very many such instances, nor can I think of an instance in which private discussion among the arbitrators led to substantive unfairness in the outcome of a case.

==Followup from [[User:Anythingyouwant|Anythingyouwant]]==
Your answer included this: &quot;[I]f the allegation is poor behavior such as chronic edit-warring or incivility over a long period of time, then 'a boatload of diffs' may be an important part of the evidence. There have been cases in which a large number of problem edits or posts resulted in sanctions, even though no one specific one would have brought the editor to arbitration.&quot;&lt;p&gt;
 	
I think you misunderstood the question.  I agree 100% that in such cases a boatload of diffs may be an important piece of evidence.&lt;p&gt;
 	
What I'm asking is, why is it not appropriate to focus on a particular example, even if everyone agrees that that example alone would not be enough for sanctions (and would not have brought the editor to arbitration).  After all, the &quot;defendant&quot; may be contending that a huge portion of the boatload may be not a collection of minor violations, but rather a collection of instances that can each be completely justified if properly contextualized.  (N.B. A thousand zeroes does not add up to anything significant.)&lt;p&gt;

In other words, the &quot;defendant&quot; may assert that a large group of diffs show not just a lack of severe problem editing, but instead a lack of any problem editing whatsoever. So why isn't it a fair request for the &quot;defendant&quot; to ask that one or a small group of diffs be identified from among the boatload, so everyone can focus on whether that particular example shows any problem editing whatsoever? Otherwise, the defendant is in the impossible position of having to concisely explain and contextualze a huge number of diffs, when instead everyone could stipulate that a much smaller group of diffs are typical, and focus on them. If analysis of the example shows no real problem, then the defendant is presumed undeserving of sanctions; but if they show a low level problem that accumulates to a large problem in combination with similar edits, then sanctions would be appropriate.[[User:Anythingyouwant|Anythingyouwant]] ([[User talk:Anythingyouwant|talk]]) 04:09, 21 November 2010 (UTC)

== Discussion of question by Moni3 ==
Well, I'm not sure my question was clear. Or rather, you answered something but not what I was looking to read. I'm looking for arbs to be able to realize that they may play a more active role in setting the often dismal tone of communication at various forums. Not necessarily to create more jobs for themselves--I do appreciate that you are a busy lot--but be able to determine and hopefully persuade Wikipedians to use a professional register, keep content and integrity in mind. Beyond setting an example, that is. Setting or participating in a campaign? I don't know. Do you see this within the scope of your duties or influence? No set government is apparently leading to an exhausting amount of pointless posturing and bickering. It's not really a community that I want to be a part of. Not like this. Surely someone somewhere agrees or sees my point. And I'm not belittling myself here. Wikipedia in theory and practice illustrates the need for editors to have no identity or self-importance. I have to be responsible for my own happiness. If removing myself from Wikipedia means one less editor is in the squabbling cacophony, then it helps, no?  --[[User:Moni3|Moni3]] ([[User talk:Moni3|talk]]) 00:20, 20 November 2010 (UTC)
:I hate pointless posturing and bickering, absolutely hate it. I even dislike posturing and bickering that has some point, because I am confident that the point can usually be made without the posturing and the bickering. I understand your point that leaders of the community&amp;mdash;and arbitrator is in some respects, though not all, a leadership position&amp;mdash;should try to tone down nastiness wherever it appears. We have a few arbitrators who try to do that from time to time, myself being one. On the other hand, it doesn't always work: &quot;civility police&quot; has become a term of disdain; we have a handful of valuable content contributors who incorrectly think that it enhances their charm and the force of their arguments when they call other editors by various names; and if the Arbitration Committee were to try to do more to set policies and government ... well, let's just say that for better or worse, prior attempts by the committee to take baby steps in that direction did not work out well. Non-administrators sometimes resent when they think that admins are trying to throw their weight around, and this is so threefold for arbitrators, no matter how often I explain that I am not speaking on behalf of the committee or anyone other than myself unless I say so.

:I have mentioned before, perhaps the first time I ran for arbitrator, that my initial introduction to editing Wikipedia was a very positive one. Soon after I made my first registered edit I received a welcome message; soon after I made my first substantial contribution to an article I received a nice note on my talkpage thanking me for improving the article; when I had some newbie questions, I posted them to the help desk and received courteous and useful responses; everyone seemed to be kind to everyone else. Within a few weeks, of course, I had come across RfA and the arbitration pages and I realized that all was not sweetness and light with the wiki; but still, a first impression is a first impression, and I think that impression is part of both why I stuck around editing, and why I evolved into the editor I became. I desperately wish we could reduce the bickering and the name-calling all over the wiki. But how do we do it? Civility blocks have, rightly or wrongly, fallen into disfavor except in pretty clear-cut cases; polite requests that people clean up their act are too often ignored, sometimes with pride; ironically, ANI and the Wikiquette alerts page, two pages created in large measure to address this type of issue, are sometimes the two least civilized pages in all of Wikipedia. I would welcome, on my talkpage, thoughts about how we can improve this problem.
 
:As a final point: Moni3, your departing from Wikipedia would not solve, and would in fact worsen, various problems, so please don't do that. [[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] ([[User talk:Newyorkbrad|talk]]) 02:02, 20 November 2010 (UTC)

==Questions from Sven Manguard==
I decided to ask these questions after reflecting on an hour long conversation over the IRC with an editor that I hold in very high regard.

# What is the greatest threat to the long term survivability or viability of Wikipedia? If the threat is currently affecting Wikipedia, what actions can be done to limit it? If the the threat is not yet affecting the project, what actions can be taken to keep it that way? What is the overall health of the project today?
#:'''A.''' The key question is whether we will maintain and expand our base of contributors. The novelty of Wikipedia as the encyclopedia that anyone can edit has worn off, so we will attract new editors&amp;mdash;both as content contributors and as future administrators, functionaries, and wikiproject leaders&amp;mdash;only if we maintain an environment that is inviting for new editors who are thinking about joining us, and for new editors who do join us. The statistics say that our participation levels have flattened after having grown exponentially for a number of years, and clearly we have fewer editors wanting to become administrators, etc., than we did awhile back.  And the attrition rate among all sectors of the community continues to be high. I think this is our biggest challenge, and our most important, because with enough high-quality editors we can accomplish great things, and without a reasonable number of high-quality editors we can't accomplish anything.
# What are the greatest strengths and greatest weaknesses of the project? What processes do we do well, and what processes fail? What content areas do we excel at and where do we need to improve?
#:'''A.''' Strengths include some of the article content (the best of the best, whether or not designated as FA or not), many of the images and other files, our diverse and talented base of editors with skills in so many areas, the collaborative atmosphere found in many (though by no means all) topic areas and processes, the technical infrastructure, and the synergistic effort of the project's success in enticing new readers and editors. Weaknesses include the less well-developed among the articles (not stubs labelled as such, but content that is problematic in other ways), the occasional attack page still masquerading undetected as a BLP, the hostility we express toward each other from time to time, the inhospitability (actual or perceived) of the project to experts on a given topic, and the increasing complexity of our various rule-sets that make it impossible for a new or even an experienced editor to become familiar with all the policies and guidelines and instructions governing a given issue. As to content, I'd like to see more and more detailed coverage of legal topics (although this is difficult because the legal system varies dramatically from one jurisdiction to the next, so it is often hard to write these articles from a global perspective). 
# What is your view on the current level of participation in Wikipedia? Does Wikipedia have enough active contributors today? Does it have too many?
#:'''A.''' Please see answer 1 above. We can always use more good contributors to all aspects of the project.
# Does Wikipedia do a good job at retaining its active contributors? What strengths and weaknesses within the project can you point to that affect retention? Are recent high profile burnouts indicative of a problem within the project or are they unfortunate but isolated events?
#:'''A.''' We could do better. The attrition rate on all areas of the project is enormous (just pick a random RfA or other discussion from two or three years ago and scan the list of participants and see how many are still around). What I don't know is whether this is something unique to Wikipedia or whether it is just part of the online world as a whole&amp;mdash;people come, people go. As I wrote above, I consider the rate at which we burn out some of our best talent to be a very serious problem. My own effort to ameliorate this problem is to approach editors who seem to be unhappy or have stated they are thinking of no longer editing, and see whether the issues that are troubling them can be addressed. When I write an arbitration decision, the first principle often defines the Purpose of Wikipedia: &quot;The purpose of Wikipedia is to create a high-quality, free-content encyclopedia in an atmosphere of cameraderie and mutual respect among the contributors.&quot; The second clause enables the first, and it implies that we care about one another and we try, when we can, to solve the issues that lead people to consider leaving.
# Do you believe that the project should prioritize on improving existing content or creating new content. Is there an ideal ratio of creation:improvement? &lt;small&gt;For the purposes of this question, assume that you have complete control over where the community as a whole focuses their efforts. This is, of course, a hypothetical situation. &lt;/small&gt;
#:'''A.''' I apologize for temporizing, but both are important. There will always be new articles to written; we will stultify if we stop new creation. But we also need to get away from any mindset that might still exist that creating a new article is, by its nature, more important or more interesting than improving an old one. If anything, the opposite is the case.
# Do you believe that Wikipedia should allow people to contribute without making accounts?
#:'''A.''' Yes, the current policy of allowing IP editing should continue. I understand the view that a high proportion of IP edits are unproductive, and could live with increased use of semiprotection (see my answer to Lar's BLP question above). However, allowing IPs to edit is a key part of the process for recruiting new editors, many of whom then go on to register accounts and become long-term Wikipedians. I rely on my own history as an example; I first edited Wikipedia, as an IP, because I discovered an error in an article, and I saw that anyone could edit the page, and I decided to fix the error, and I did. After a few more instances of that, I decided to register. But there is little if any possibility I would have bothered registering to fix that initial error, so I count myself as among those whose entire Wikipedia career was facilitated by the fact that editing by unregistered users is allowed. 
# If you could make one change to Wikipedia, what would it be, and why?
#:'''A.'''&lt;small&gt;&lt;s&gt;I would prohibit asking ArbCom candidates more than six questions in a row, especially when the candidate is answering them at 2:30 a.m.&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/small&gt;Two thoughts here. On the editorial side, I would enhance our efforts to address BLP related problems. On the community side, I would have us be kinder to one another, both for its own sake and to improve our rate of retaining contributors.

== Questions from BorisG ==

#As requested, please comment on Iridescent's views regarding your attitude and stance on Wikipedia as given on her candidate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2010/Candidates/Iridescent discussion page]. Thanks.
#:'''A.''' Thanks for the question. I was ready to answer it immediately after you proposed it, but I realized that the answer I'd formulated in my head would run on much too long, and since that's part of Iridescent's critique of me, it would be foolish of me to feed into it more than I can help.
#:
#:When I saw Eva Destruction's initial comments about me on Wikipedia Review (quoted now in the discussion you link to), I thought they were terribly unfair to me as a description of the work I'd done in my (then) two years of arbitrating. My response at the time on WR was:
#::&quot;I generally prefer to let my work as an arbitrator speak for itself, and I respect everyone's right to an opinion about it, but I am honestly startled by the vitriol of this [post]. Putting aside subjective points of disagreement, I would note, among other things, that: (1) I can't think of anyone, &quot;friend&quot; or &quot;enemy&quot; or otherwise, for whom I've ever voted &quot;the harshest punishment&quot; (or even a mildly harsh punishment) for &quot;trivial errors&quot; or anything other than fairly serious misbehavior; (2) I almost always explain my reasons for voting as I do when it is not obvious, perhaps more frequently than any other sitting arbitrator; (3) none of my &quot;real-life buddies&quot; even edit Wikipedia, much less have they been involved in arbitrations in which I could &quot;back them up&quot; (unless this is merely a reference to people I've met occasionally at meet-ups, but I don't recall even any of them as parties to ArbCom cases); (4) far from uniformly supporting consensus as it emerges, I've almost surely cast more dissenting votes in my two years on the committee than has anyone else; and (5) my average edit length is at least six percent shorter than FT2's.&quot;
#:I also sent a PM to ED/Iridescent, and without divulging anything that was written to me privately, I think that I was able to address some of Iridescent's concerns about specific cases, and I also got a better sense of what was troubling Iridescent about my arbitrating, which basically corresponds to Irisdescent's comment about me now. Specifically, I note Iridescent's description of me as someone who &quot;sees Wikipedia's primary purpose as the advancement of the community with the improvement of the content secondary, while [Iridescent sees] its primary purpose as the advancement of the content and the community side only important insofar as it advances that.&quot; That is not a correct statement of my wiki-worldview and it never has been. Here's a key paragraph from what I wrote to Iridescent at the time:
#::&quot;You say that I promote Wikipedia as a social network rather than an encyclopedia.  Since I came to Wikipedia to write articles before some of my attention got diverted to adminning and arbing, that is a significant charge.  The fact is, of course, that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, but it is an encyclopedia ''written by volunteers'', many of whom are looking for some form of validation or enjoyment to induce them to stick around.  Your comment here resonates with Kelly Martin's critique of me, which is that I privilege the community over the encylopedia.  My response is that I promote the community both for the happiness of its members but also for the long-term health of the encyclopedia, which is built and maintained by the individuals that sustain it; I don't see &quot;the encyclopedia versus the community&quot; as a meaningful distinction.  My standard introduction to arbitration cases, the &quot;Purpose of Wikipedia&quot; clause, reads:  &quot;The purpose of Wikipedia is to create a high-quality, free-content encyclopedia in an atmosphere of comaraderie and mutual respect among the contributors.&quot;  I do not consider that the last few words are superfluous.&quot;
#:In other words, I have never accepted the distinction that some people attempt to draw between &quot;those who believe the encyclopedia is more important than the community (or the contributors)&quot; and &quot;those who believe the community is more important than the encyclopedia.&quot; It's a false dichotomy: we have no encyclopedia without the community and its members who create and edit and support and nurture it; and we have no community without the encyclopedia project that defines us. This has been my opinion since I first starting thinking about meta issues in 2006; it remains my opinion, and I think any other analysis is ultimately a short-sighted one.
#:
#:(And I expect that, upon thinking about it, Iridescent would not completely disagree. If one takes a look at [[User talk:Iridescent]] (maybe not this week, when it is full of election-related posts, but ordinarily), one will find lots of content-related discussion, but also plenty of banter and chitchat among Iridescent and Iridescent's wikifriends. There's nothing wrong with that; it's part of what a user talkpage is for, and I do plenty of it myself; the point is that yes, there is sometimes a bit of a social aspect to what we do here: we praise each other, we support each other, and we do it because ''no one is going to contribute to Wikipedia, at least not for the right reasons, if they are not having fun.'' As another example, I recent posted to the talkpage of a particular user who had been blocked indefinitely and had just been unblocked, cautioning him to behave appropriately if he wanted to stay unblocked. This was not an editor who spends his wikilife creating mounds of content; he contributes from time to time, but his main role has frankly been to provide some amusement. I intervened as I did, quite intentionally, because I thought this was a more interesting place with him in it and I wanted to steer him away from the edge. It may even have worked. Was I wrong to do that?)
#:
#:There are two ironies here. The first is that, for a time, I was told that some people considered me too dry, too humorless, too &quot;serious&quot; a persona. That was never a fair critique either, if I say so myself, but I took it to heart anyway. Perhaps I overcompensated a little. I don't think I did so in any way that affected my arbitrating.
#:
#:The second irony is that it has become clear that I have a higher opinion of Iridescent than Iridescent has of me. During the course of this election, partly as a break from my own process of answering candidate questions and partly out of curiosity about my (if I am reelected) future colleagues, I have been following the other candidates' answers to the questions they have been asked. There are several candidates who have given good answers to the question sets, and I consider Iridescent's to be among the best (and I can only envy the pithy writing style). This is clearly someone who has thought seriously about what this project is and how well we are doing what we do; and (to answer a question that Iridescent was asked and that I anticipate I might be asked), I envision no problems working collegially alongside Iridescent if both of us are elected.

#Sorry here is another tough one (time permitting). A major criticism of the current arbitration (and governance) system is that it focuses too much on conduct at the expense of content, which is, arguably, the goal of the whole enterprise. This is summarised nicely in [[User:Heimstern/ArbCom|essay on the Arbitration Committee|Heimstern's essay]]. Do you agree there is a problem? What ''needs'' and ''can'' be done about it, if anything? Can ArbCom do anything in particular. - [[User:BorisG|BorisG]] ([[User talk:BorisG|talk]]) 03:35, 27 November 2010 (UTC)
#:'''A.''' It's a good essay. I do think there is more of a realization nowadays that POV-pushing is POV-pushing and fringe-advocacy is fringe-advocacy, even if the editor steers away from personal attacks and four-letter words. I'm perfectly open to sanctioning such users in appropriate cases: there comes a point where adding inappropriate content does become a user-conduct issue. However, for better or worse, I think that arbitrators would be strung up from lampposts if the Arbitration Committee were to announce a new system for resolving content disputes, and the bodies would be set afire before we were quite dead if we had announced that we would be resolving the content disputes ourselves.

== Questions from EdChem ==

1.  In [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Shell_Kinney&amp;diff=398601858&amp;oldid=398354628 this comment], Arbitrator Roger Davies was responding to criticisms of the findings of fact in the recent Climate Change case.  He wrote that: &quot;Their purpose is not to build a watertight case against someone, nor to convince the sanctioned editor of the errors of his/her ways, but to give other arbitrators a flavour of the problem.&quot; Do you agree with this comment?  To what extent should Findings of Fact be persuasive of editors watching a case, the editors directly involved, and the non-drafting Arbitrators?  Is it sufficient for non-drafting Arbitrators to base their views primarily on the drafted Findings?  Please note, the intended focus of this question is not the specific Findings about which Roger was being criticised but rather the general issue of your view of the purpose of Findings of Fact.
:'''A.''' I understand the point that Roger was making, in that when a finding is based on an editor's behavior over a long period of time, it's not practicable to include every diff that might support the finding. However, it will usually be good practice to include at least a truly representative sample, or alternatively to link to a section of evidence that does include them. This is especially important when the arbitrators disagree about whether there is sufficient evidence to support a finding. You will have seen instances in which I initially express reservations about a particular finding and then more to support (or don't as the case may be) as additional evidence is added to it. As for the role of non-drafting arbitrators, my practice is to carefully review the evidence and workshop submissions just as I would in a case I was writing, but not necessarily to review every diff (or at least every diff that might be relevant) as I would in a case on which I was primary drafter. Whether or not I am the drafter, I also carefully follow responses (by arbitrators, parties, and others) to proposed decision paragraphs, on the workshop or on the proposed decision talkpage, and these are important in identifying findings that might not have adequate support, in addition to my own individual analysis.
2.  There have been situations during cases where groups of editors have been calling for, or even pleading for, clarification of arbitrators' views.  Some examples include:
*In ''Mantanmoreland'', when it was unclear whether statistical evidence was persuasive, and whether further evidence would have been useful.
*In ''Climate Change'', when it was unclear whether arbitrators recognised the flaw in the statements relating to Scibaby false positives.
*In ''Matthew Hoffman'', when it was unclear how arbitrators viewed the controversial actions of some of their colleagues.
*In the ''OrangeMarlin'' incident, where a desire to provide a unified ArbCom position left the community unclear on the views of individual arbitrators.
I could list other examples, but these are sufficient (I believe) to illustrate my questions, which are: how should / do arbitrators go about handling the need to reveal information that is in the community's interests to know as opposed to information that is instead only of interest to the community.  How would you respond to the idea of a mechanism by which questions could be posed to the committee where arbitrators would be obligated to provide a direct and timely response?
:'''A.''' I'll discuss the specific examples and then the general question. In ''Mantanmoreland'', when the proposed decision proved so controversial, I posted an extremely (in retrospect, overly) long explanation of how we got to the decision we did on the proposed decision talkpage. The bottom line in that case was that some arbitrators found the statistical evidence in that case compelling and others found it unconvincing, so it was not possible to articulate a committee position on the issue. My own view is that such evidence can be extremely useful but only in conjunction with other evidence (which amply existed in ''Mantanmoreland''). In ''Climate change'', we ultimately eliminated the 20-40% reference from the adopted finding because of the expressed concern that it was either incorrect or ambiguous, which I think makes it clear we recognized there was an issue with it. It is awkward for me to comment on ''Matthew Hoffman'', because my term as an arbitrator began right in the middle of the case, but I think I did have some comments at the time of the case about various aspects of it. (Something interesting I've just noticed in skimming the proposed decision talkpage in that case is that some issues about blocking and unblocking protocols in that case strongly parallel those in the recent ''MickMacNee'' request that we recently considered). I was not an active arbitrator when the Orangemarlin incident happened (see answer to question 3 just below), so I didn't have a role on that one.
:More generally, I do think it is important that arbitrators respond to reasonable inquiries from parties and others, at least so long as they are good-faith inquiries and do not cross the line into repetitious venting at a decision one doesn't agree with (I don't mean to suggest that any of the instances you mention above crossed that line). I do my best to do so, on workshops and proposed decision talkpages; this may be more clear on smaller cases (where a few arbitrator comments stand out clearly on a workshop) as opposed to in the enormous cases, where any number of comments may be swallowed up in the overgrown workshop or the proposed decision archives.

3.  You were an arbitrator at the time of the ''OrangeMarlin'' affair, which FT2 has described in his extended statement ([[User:FT2/ACE2010 extended statement]] under &quot;The OrangeMarlin debacle (long)&quot;).  That statement raises issues of judgment about both FT2 and the rest of the Committee at the time.  Do you have any comment to make, either on the accuracy of FT2's account from your perspective, or on your own involvement?
:'''A.''' The ''Orangemarlin'' incident in the summer of 2008 occurred while I was not editing or arbitrating and had announced that I was retired (see response to Chaser's individual question above)&amp;mdash;as discussed above, a one-time situation. During this period of time, I was still subscribed to the arbcom-l mailing list, as my colleagues were trying to talk me into returning to Wikipedia: they soon succeeded, as I was quite miserable at having had to depart in the way I did; and in fact, seeing the Committee struggling with not just the Orangemarlin matter but others as well was one of the reasons I returned. But I was not reading every post at the time, although I believe I did have some internal comments about how the mess might best be cleaned up. I won't say that if I'd been an active arbitrator at the time, I would have stopped what occurred; on the other hand, I'd like to think I might have. In any event, the lesson that &quot;silence does not equal consent on an active mailing list, except perhaps for minor or ministerial matters as to which it would be unreasonable to wait for everyone's input&quot; has been learned, and I don't think we'll see anything like this happening again.

4.  In the fallout from the ''Randy'' outing accusations and the subsequent AUSC report, Giano was blocked by Coren and quickly unblocked by John Vandenberg.  In the [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration/Requests/Case&amp;oldid=332941791#GiacomoReturned RfAr] that followed, JV wrote &quot;As other members of the Committee know, there have been prior incidents of Coren taking action without strong Committee backing. It is my opinion that this most recent block of Giano was another such example of poor judgment on Coren's part.&quot; and also that &quot;Coren wisely does not want to name me as part of this &quot;spat&quot;, and would like us all to disregard the context. That is not going to happen folks.&quot;  This clearly adds to the perception that ArbCom closes ranks to protect its own.  Have there been situations (to do with the ''Randy'' incident or otherwise) where you felt that the community had a right or need to know something, but that has not been disclosed for reasons of protecting an individual arbitrator or ArbCom as an institution?  How important is protecting the reputation of ArbCom itself?
:'''A.''' The sight of arbitrators bickering and calling each other names is as unedifying to me as the sight of other editors bickering and calling each other names; part of the ethos of Wikipedia is supposed to be that we work colleagially and respect one another and one another's contributions. That being said, I have seen plenty of instances on-wiki, and more off-wiki, where we criticize each other's views and approaches and actions with respect to cases. Since I probably have cast more solo dissenting votes in the past couple of years than anyone else, I've received my share of these. There is a natural instinct for people in the same group not to be ''unnecessarily'' controntational toward one another, especially when they are going to be working together for a long time: this is one reason why if administrator A reverses a block that admin B has imposed, A will write in the unblock message, &quot;I think that this block is an overreaction so I have unblocked you&quot;, rather than &quot;sorry about that block I've just lifted, but Admin B was being a dumbass again.&quot; Of course, we do have some people who would write the latter, and there may be rare circumstances where (with some editing) it would be the right thing to say, but not ''usually''. There is also the complicating factor that in some instances, an arbitrator's action is (rightly or wrongly) based on non-public information, so either Arbitrator X can't fairly criticize Y without revealing the non-public information, or X knows that if he criticizes Y, Y would be unable to fairly defend himself without doing so.
:In incidents of really serious problems, I think the committee has done what needed to be done: I don't think FT2 believes he was exempted from criticism during the Orangemarlin situation, or thereafter; Sam Blacketer's resignation was accepted immediately after we found out what had occurred (that revelation truly shocked me, as Sam had been a good arbitrator); and so on.
:The &quot;Randy in Boise&quot; fiasco involved an almost comical misinterpretation of innocuous remarks, brought about partly because a couple of arbitrators and functionaries were unfamiliar with a particular trope, and partly because when an editor develops a reputation for sardonic and sarcastic observations, an expectation may be created that his ''every'' comment is in the same vein, which is not the case. Given that one of the parties is no longer participating in the project, let's leave it at that. 

5.  In the ''Climate Change'' case, you asked that questions to be addressed be suggested.  In an answer above, you have noted the breadth and tone of those questions as being problematic.  I thought the innovation was a good idea, and was disappointed that it wasn't apparent how it influenced the case.  Perhaps if requesting questions during the evidence phase became a standard part of a case, before the workshop opens the arbitrators could go through and provide a list of (say) five questions that they see as being raised by the suggestions and the evidence and amenable to ArbCom resolution.  This list would not mandate what happened afterwards, but could both guide the contributions on the workshop phase and indicate where the evidence was seen as being substantial and insubstantial.  From your experience with cases, does this sort of approach seem practicable?
:I still do see it as being useful if we have other cases where (i) the scope of the case is not entirely well-defined at the outset, and (ii) the level of acrimony among the parties is not such that questions list will be full of queries along the lines of &quot;Should User:X be taken out and shot?&quot; I think I've mentioned elsewhere that I was planning to try a variation of it in the ''MickMacNee'' case, when it looked like we were going to take the case and I would be one of the drafters. Another variation is for arbitrators to ask parties and commenters to be more specific about what issues they think a decision might address, in their statements at the accept-or-decline stage.

== Follow-up questions from Carcharoth ==

A few follow-up questions, some related to your answers to the existing questions:
*In your candidate statement you say: ''&quot;The community was extraordinarily kind to me in the 2007 election&quot;''. This was three years ago. Given the changes in Wikipedia and its community over those three years, how valid do you think that mandate is now, given that some of those voting then may no longer be active on Wikipedia?
**'''A.''' That mandate is about to expire, along with my term of office. The question for the voters now is whether to give me a fresh one.
*In your candidate statement, you also refer to: ''&quot;the outside public who rely on Wikipedia millions of times every day&quot;''. How relevant do you think ArbCom is to the outside public?
**'''A.''' The Arbitration Committee has virtually no relevance to the general public if one asks whether the typical reader, or even the typical editor, has ever heard of it or dealt with it. (The press coverage of our decision in ''Scientology'' was a rare exception.) The committee's relevance to the general public is in its role in contributing to a culture throughout the site and the community that encourages high-quality contributions by knowledgeable, mutually respectful contributors.
*In your answer to general question 3c, you say: ''&quot;it has now been incorporated into the relevant policy page, which is probably the best sign that a principle initiated in one of our decisions has received acceptance in the broader community&quot;'' Have you checked to see whether the wording in question was added following a well-attended discussion, or was it added by someone citing the ArbCom case and meeting no objections?
**'''A.''' There was discussion of the added paragraph at the time (I believe I actually added it myself), and there was consensus to include it. It's also been cited in various ANI discussions since then (sometimes even not by myself), which again confirms that it is useful. The principle was motivated in part by a concern that in general, ANI discussions of &quot;this user made a legal threat&quot; situations have sometimes been too simplistic, focusing on whether what the user said technically was or was not a legal threat and should or should not therefore be blocked, while ignoring other relevant aspects such as whether the user can be induced to express his or her concern in a more appropriate fashion without being blocked, and whether there is merit to the user's underlying grievance. I think there has been some improvement in this situation recently.  
*In your answer to general question 5, you say: ''&quot;I remember at least one time, before I was an arbitrator, when the committee seemingly invented a new policy for the purpose of resolving a case&quot;''. Can you remember which case this was? You also say that you have ''included in several committee decisions [...] a remedy calling for the community to revisit a policy or guidelines page with a view toward clarifying unclear and disputed issues&quot;''. You mention the possible outcomes, but are you aware of cases where such an issue remains unresolved and the issue then came up before the committee again in a future case? If so, should the committee vote through the same proposals from the previous case, or should they reconsider in light of the absence of community discussion on the issue, or should they take a different approach?
**I was referring to the so-called ''Giano'' case in the fall of 2006, which I believe introduced the principle that functionaries or administrators who resign their tools are entitled to have them returned upon request, unless they resigned &quot;under a cloud.&quot; (The phrase &quot;under a cloud&quot; was later changed to &quot;under controversial circumstances&quot; or &quot;under circumstances of controversy&quot; at my request, as I found the &quot;cloud&quot; wording excessively harsh.) I don't recall any policy or guideline anywhere that had expressed this principle before this case, but it made sense, and no one objected that it represented creation of policy by the Arbitration Committee ''ex nihilo''. As for your second question, a clear example of policy that has remained unclear for ''years'' relates to blocking and unblocking protocols: under what circumstances, for example, Administrator A is entitled to unblock a user blocked by Administrator B. (I won't define here all the subissues and permutations, unless someone asks, but they are numerous.) As for your last question, the answer has to be that this is a decision to be made on a case-by-case basis; sorry not to be more helpful than that, but there is no way to respond to that question in a vacuum.
*In your answer to general question 7, you say you: ''&quot;wrote the final decision with participation by SirFozzie&quot;''. However, SirFozzie's answer to general question 1 says that he was ''the primary drafting arbitrator of the Alastair Haines 2 arbitration case, along with User:Newyorkbrad&quot;''. Two questions here: (i) Was there a primary drafter and who was it? (ii) Does it matter who is considered the primary drafter, given that drafts are sometimes reworked at a later stage of the process?
**The structure and substance of the proposed decision in ''Alastair Haines 2'' was the result of collaboration between SirFozzie and me, with supportive input from other arbitrators as well. So, I would say we were both primary drafters. I think I was the one who put most of the words on the paper (well, the screen), but to some extent that's just the scrivener function. It is fair for us to share the credit and/or blame for that decision. And no, I don't think it matters who is the primary drafter of a decision (any more or less than it matters who gets &quot;credit&quot; for any other page of Wikipedia); and yes, drafts are frequently revised from the first one that is posted. (See also answer to next question.)
*Related to the above, one of my follow-up questions to SirFozzie related to the practice of how teams of case drafters work in practice. For cases where you worked with a co-drafter (including the case where there were three drafters), could you say how the workload was shared, and how much communication there was with your co-drafter(s)? Do you think for complex cases, co-drafting is the way to go, and would you say that for simpler cases, 'solo' drafting is better?
**It varies greatly from case to case; there is no ironclad rule. A lot depends, quite frankly, on how many arbitrators there are at any one time with the particular drafting skills involved in writing clear decisions and the inclination to spend their arbitration time in this fashion. An arbitrator working behind the scenes to compile diffs may be just as important to the outcome of a case as the one who performs what I identified just above as the scrivener function. Looking over the list of cases in the past three years and identifying the ones I drafted, I see cases in which my draft became the final decision pretty much unchanged (e.g. ''Jim62sch'', ''R. fiend'', ''International Churches of Christ'', ''Betacommand 2'', ''Sarah Palin protection wheel war'', ''Abtract-Collectonian'', ''MZMcBride'', ''Seeyou''), cases in which my proposed decision was outvoted on-wiki in significant part, in retrospect for good reason (e.g. ''John Buscema'', my first decision), cases in which I allowed myself to be talked out of my first draft of the decision and it soon became clear I should have stuck to my guns (''Mantanmoreland'', ''Mattisse''), and cases in which I added materially to decisions drafted by other arbitrators; every case is different. Co-drafter collaboration can be anything from &quot;you look at this issue and I'll look at that issue&quot; to &quot;here's a draft, let me know what you think,&quot; or anything in between. The one thing that it is best to avoid, when the human resources permit, is a situation where one arbitrator has to do substantially all of the drafting in almost every case, as has happened for a considerable part of the committee's existence, but not recently.
*Another questions about case management relates to clerking of cases, and I'm asking you because you were a clerk yourself at one stage. Would you be able to provide some thoughts on how clerking of cases has changed over the years, and whether you would push for further change in this, or whether you are happy with the status quo. This question applies particularly for the more complex cases that come before the committee.
**As I've mentioned elsewhere, the sheer number of cases the committee decides, and hence the number of cases to be clerked, has declined radically in the past three years, but the average complexity of each individual case has increased. This means that the Clerk's role has become less of a ministerial one (creating case templates, notifying parties, calculating majorities, etc.) and more of a case-management one (refereeing arguments on the case pages, warning parties who are becoming excessively obnoxious during the case, etc.). There is also an increased number of requests for clarification and amendment that requires the Clerks' attention. The difficult question is to what extent the Clerks should be responsible for (e.g.) telling an editor that he or she is in danger of a block or page-ban for misconduct on an arbitration-related page, and to what extent it is up to the arbitrators to do this. The arbitrators will be perceived as having more ultimate authority on the arbitration pages than the Clerks who are their delegates, but an arbitrator who gets embroiled in disputes ''within'' the case risks accusations of prejudgment.
*In your answer to ScottyBerg's question, you say: ''&quot;Second, we took three requests for arbitration and rolled them into one because the subjects were generally related; we might have been better off after all if we'd taken them as three separate cases.&quot;'' How do you think this would have worked in practice, and how would you have handled overlap between the separate cases?
**The two smaller cases could probably have been decided much faster than the main case if they'd been handled on their own, and the outcome might have been clearer. It turned out that there wasn't all that much overlap in the bodies of evidence for the three cases rolled into one; the problem is that this wasn't clearly going to be so when we started. To the extent the evidence did overlap, we could have posted a cross-reference reciting that all evidence presented in the smaller cases would have been deemed as having been presented in the main case as well. This is all 20:20 hindsight, though.
*Finally, not questions, but I'm impressed that you managed to refer to an Isaac Asimov short story in the context of an ArbCom election, and I agree 100% with your follow-up reply to Moni3's response to your response to her question (the post you made at 02:02, 20 November 2010, yes I know it would be easier to give a diff!), and I also found your reply to BorisG's first question excellent, even if your reply to his second question was a bit too vivid in terms of imagery for my taste.
**To your first point, thank you (and I've been pointed to a Damon Knight story by way of rebuttal, which I still need to track down); to your second point, thank you again; to your third point, I've been accused (correctly) of an overly flabby and bland writing style, so once in awhile it's fun to surprise people.
Thanks for standing as a candidate in these elections, and thanks for taking the time to answer these questions. [[User:Carcharoth|Carcharoth]] ([[User talk:Carcharoth|talk]]) 02:34, 29 November 2010 (UTC)

== Discussion of Shooterwalker question ==

#::: Thanks. And to be clear, you think such remedies have been a net positive for the project? And have no further suggestions to ensure their success? (You don't have to take the bait if you don't want to. Just curious.) [[User:Shooterwalker|Shooterwalker]] ([[User talk:Shooterwalker|talk]]) 12:59, 24 November 2010 (UTC)
#:::: Well, the remedies have been successful in the limited sense that we don't have people edit-warring over the Ireland or West Bank/J&amp;S article names any more. Whether they were the best possible solutions for the issues they addressed is a different question. (For the record, I was recused in the latter case, so had no responsibility for the remedies in that case.) As a more general matter, I've often thought we ought to have a mechanism for following up on both accepted and declined requests for arbitration a few months after we dispose of them, and check in on whether the underlying issues in the case have been solved, and I do a little spot-checking sometimes, but typically we haven't followed up on the end results of closed cases that unless there is a problem that brings the case back before us with an amendment or clarification request or the like. [[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] ([[User talk:Newyorkbrad|talk]]) 01:56, 27 November 2010 (UTC)
#::::: Very clear. Thanks and good luck! [[User:Shooterwalker|Shooterwalker]] ([[User talk:Shooterwalker|talk]]) 02:43, 27 November 2010 (UTC)

== Question from Offliner ==

Do you believe the nationalities of Wikipedia's editors are fairly represented in the current ArbCom? Could you please reveal your own nationality? If you do not wish to reveal your exact nationality, could you at least state whether you are from an anglophone country? [[User:Offliner|Offliner]] ([[User talk:Offliner|talk]]) 18:07, 30 November 2010 (UTC)
:I agree that it is always desirable for the committee, as all other aspects of Wikipedia, to encompass a diverse and worldwide group. Of course that is subject to constraints, the most important of which is who chooses to volunteer for which tasks within the project. For my own part, it's generally known that I'm from the United States. [[User:Newyorkbrad|Newyorkbrad]] ([[User talk:Newyorkbrad|talk]]) 20:33, 30 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

Hello, Mrghost624, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Mrghost624|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Abcyst]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:
* [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|Starting an article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons|Biographies of living persons]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date. If you have any questions, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]] or ask me on my talk page. &lt;!-- Template:First article --&gt; Again, welcome!&amp;nbsp;[[User:Lerdthenerd|Lerdthenerd]] ([[User talk:Lerdthenerd|talk]]) 17:41, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

==Your contributed article, [[Abcyst]]==
[[Image:Information icon4.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
Hello, I notice that you recently created a new page, '''[[:Abcyst]]'''. First, thank you for your contribution; Wikipedia relies solely on the efforts of volunteers such as you. Unfortunately, the page you created covers a topic on which we already have pages - '''[[:Abcess]]''' and '''[[Cyst]]'''. Because of the duplication, your article has been tagged for [[WP:A10|speedy deletion]]. Please note that this is not a comment on you personally and we hope you will to continue helping improve Wikipedia. If the topic of the article you created is one that interests you, then perhaps you would like to help out at [[:Abcess]] - you might like to discuss new information at [[Talk:Abcess|the article's talk page]]. 

If you think that the article you created should remain separate, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Abcyst|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Abcyst|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. Additionally if you would like to have someone review articles you create before they go live so they are not nominated for deletion shortly after you post them, allow me to suggest the [[WP:AFC|article creation process]] and using our search feature to find related information we already have in the encyclopedia. Try not to be discouraged. Wikipedia looks forward to your future contributions. [[User:JohnCD|JohnCD]] ([[User talk:JohnCD|talk]]) 20:48, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, Merenegade, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/Merenegade|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[Emee]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

A tag has been placed on [[:Emee]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about a band or musician, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Emee|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Emee|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:43, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Joint Interagency Task Force West''' ('''JIATFW''', '''JIATF-W''', or '''JIATF West''') is a [[Federal government of the United States|United States federal]] task forces with the responsibility to combat [[illegal drug trade]]-related [[transnational organized crime]] in the [[Asia-Pacific]] region. The Asia-Pacific area of responsibility for JIATF West includes 36 nations and nearly half of the world's population. JIATF West is one of two Joint Interagency Task Forces with a counter-narcotics mission. The other is [[Joint Interagency Task Force South]]. The task force is run as the &quot;executive agent&quot; of the [[United States Pacific Command]] (USPACOM) and is charged with providing [[U.S. Department of Defense]] &quot;support to law enforcement for counterdrug and drug-related activities.&quot; Approximately 166 [[active duty]] and [[Reserve components of the United States armed forces|reserve]] U.S. military forces, Department of Defense civilian employees and contractors, and U.S. and foreign law enforcement agency personnel are members of the task force. [http://www.pacom.mil/web/site_pages/staff%20directory/jiatfwest/jiatfwest.shtml]

The [[Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] of the [[United States Department of State]] describes the task force's mission as to &quot;[i]n cooperation with U.S. interagency and foreign partners, conduct activities to detect, disrupt, and dismantle drug-related transnational threats in Asia and the Pacific in order to protect U.S. security interests at home and abroad.&quot; [http://www.state.gov/p/inl/rls/137311.htm]

JIATF West lists its &quot;task force partners&quot; as including the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]; the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), [[National Geospatial Intelligence Agency]] (NGA), [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] (NCIS); [[United States Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP), [[United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE); and the [[Australian Customs Service]], [[Australian Federal Police]], and [[New Zealand Police]]. [http://www.pacom.mil/web/site_pages/staff%20directory/jiatfwest/jiatfwest.shtml]

The Director of the Task Force is [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] James E. Rendon. [http://www.pacom.mil/web/site_pages/staff%20directory/jiatfwest/jiatfwest.shtml]

==History==
JIATF West was established in 1989 as '''Joint Task Force-Five''' ('''JTF-5'''), headquartered on [[Coast Guard Island]] in [[Alameda, California]]. JTF-5 was created after the [[National Defense Authorization Act]] for Fiscal Year 1989 established the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] as the lead agency for the Detection and Monitoring (D&amp;M) of maritime and aerial drug trafficking into the [[United States]] and directed the department to carry out these activities in support of U.S. Law Enforcement activities.  Joint Task Forces Four (JTF-4), Five (JTF-5), and Six (JTF-6) were activated by the department in early calendar year 1989 to carry out this D&amp;M mission.  The mission of the JTFs was expanded by Section 1004 of the 1991 [[National Defense Authorization Act]] to include ten additional specific categories of support that the department could provide to law enforcement agencies.  This authority is in addition to the already assigned mission of D&amp;M and has been continuously re-authorized since 1991.  

In 1994, the newly signed National Interdiction Command and Control Plan (NICCP) redesignated the JTFs as Joint Interagency Task Forces (JIATFs). JTF-5 was redesignated as Joint Interagency Task Force West. JTF-4 was redesignated JIATF East and given responsibility for the [[Caribbean]]. [[Joint Task Force 6]] was redesignated JIATF South and given responsibility for the [[Mexico – United States border]]. (In 1999, JIATF East was merged with JIATF South). 

JTF-5 was designated as Joint Interagency Task Force West in 1994. In 2004, JIATF West was relocated to [[Camp H. M. Smith]] in [[Hawaii]] and collocated with Commander, United States Pacific Command to restructure, refocusing counterdrug efforts exclusively in the Asia-Pacific region. JIATF West serves as the USPACOM's executive agent for all counterdrug and counterdrug-related support to law enforcement in the Asia-Pacific fight against transnational crime.

Hello, and [[Wikipedia:Introduction|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/94.175.5.137|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Here are some pages you might like to see:

* [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|The five pillars of Wikipedia]]
* [[Help:Contents|Help pages]]
* [[Wikipedia:Tutorial|Tutorial]]
* [[Wikipedia:How to edit a page|How to edit a page]] and [[Wikipedia:Article development|How to develop articles]]
* [[Wikipedia:Your first article|How to create your first article]] (using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] if you wish)
* [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]]

You are welcome to continue editing articles without [[Special:Userlogin|logging in]], but many editors recommend that you '''&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[{{fullurl:Special:Userlogin|type=signup}} create an account]&lt;/span&gt;'''. Doing so is free, requires no personal information, and provides several benefits such as the ability to create articles. For a full outline and explanation of the benefits that come with creating an account, please see [[Wikipedia:Why create an account?|this page]]. If you edit without a username, your [[IP address]] (94.175.5.137) is used to identify you instead.

In any case, I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your comments]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your IP address (or username if you're logged in) and the date. If you need help, check out [[Wikipedia:Questions]], ask me on [[User talk:Mechanical digger|my talk page]], or ask your question and then place &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Wikipedians looking for help|helpme]]&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; before the question on this page. Again, welcome! &lt;!-- Template:welcome-anon --&gt; [[User:Mechanical digger|Mechanical digger]] ([[User talk:Mechanical digger|talk]]) 18:02, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

I have added a suitable paragraph on Abbey's sacking, please don't add your guess or the rumour you heard as to what the misconduct was, Wikipedia has a policy of [[WP:Verifiability]] which editors must abide by.

'''Jimmy Nelson''' (born December 15, 1928) is an American [[ventriloquist]] who appeared on [[television]] in the 1950s and 1960s. He is most famous for commercials for [[Nestlé]] chocolate featuring [[Farfel the Dog]]. He also hosted a children's show sponsored by Nestlé.

==Early life==
Jimmy Nelson was born in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] on December 15, 1928. When he was ten years old, his aunt won a toy [[ventriloquist's dummy]] named &quot;Dummy Dan&quot; in a [[Bingo (card game)|Bingo]] game and gave it to her nephew for [[Christmas]]. He learned ventriloquism, and a year later, his father upgraded the dummy's mouth control from a simple string-and-loop to a lever-system like those used in professional ventriloquist's dummies.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy&gt;{{cite web
   |url        = http://www.talkingcomedy.com/SI-Vent-2005/legends-siVENT05/JN-LGND-siVENT05.html
   |title      = Jimmy Nelson: Warm Memories of Danny O' Day, Farfel, &amp; Chaaawwwwclate
   |author     = J.C. Johnson
   |publisher  = Talking Comedy.com
   |year       = 2005
   |accessdate = 2010-11-16
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nelson began taking &quot;Dan&quot; to school, where his fourth-grade teacher allowed him to use the dummy when speaking in front of the class. In this way, Nelson taught himself to overcome his fear of public speaking. He soon started using jokes in his presentation, discovering he could make his classmates laugh.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy/&gt;

He then started performing for church groups, schools and American Legion posts. By the time he was a teenager, he started earning money competing in amateur talent contests held at the local movie theatres, where the prize was five dollars for the most popular act.

==Professional career==
In 1945, Nelson asked famed Chicago ventriloquist figure maker Frank Marshall to make him a professional-quality dummy. Marshall, who had made [[Edgar Bergen|Edgar Bergen's]] ''Charlie McCarthy'' and [[Paul Winchell|Paul Winchell's]] ''Jerry Mahoney'', would only do this after seeing the ventriloquist's work. He came to one of Nelson's theatre performances and was impressed, so sold Nelson a custom-made dummy, which he always carved to bear a resemblance to the ventriloquist.

Nelson gave Dummy Dan's replacement the full name ''Danny O'Day'', which he chose because it contained none of the [[consonants]] impossible for ventriloquists to say without moving the lips, unlike &quot;McCarthy&quot; and &quot;Mahoney&quot;. He then hired a manager and started touring professionally.&lt;ref name=TalkingComedy/&gt;

By 1947, Nelson was a professional success and Danny O'Day began to show signs of wear, so Nelson hired Marshall to build him a second one. However, Marshall's hand-carved originals (which he tailored to the personality of the ventriloquist) were impossible to duplicate identically, and Nelson felt the second dummy didn't look sufficiently like Danny to replace him. So he decided to maintain Danny, and added heavy eyebrows, eyeglasses and a beret to the new dummy, creating a foil for Danny named ''Humphrey Higsbye''.

In September 1950, Nelson made his first appearance with Danny on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]].

===Farfel the dog===
One night that year, while working a late show in a [[Wichita, Kansas]] nightclub, he picked up a stuffed dog a patron had left on the piano, and improvised a low-pitched voice to make it talk. This gave him the idea for a new character which he had Marshall build. He named it [[Farfel the Dog|Farfel]], after the [[Farfel|Jewish pasta dish]] he had seen on the menu of the [[Borscht Belt]] resorts in [[upstate New York]] where he performed.

===Television career===
In 1950, Nelson was hired as a regular on the [[Texaco Star Theatre]] TV show hosted by [[Milton Berle]]. Nelson and Danny O'Day would appear in [[Texaco]] [[gas jockey]] uniforms.

At one point, he added another animal dummy to his character repertoire, a [[cat]] named ''Ftatateeta'' after a character in [[George Bernard Shaw|George Bernard Shaw's]] play [[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]].

===Nestlé commercials===
In 1955, the Nestlé company hired Nelson to do commercials selling their chocolate candy and [[Nesquik|Nestlé's Quik]] chocolate milk flavoring. The Nestlé executives had him audition by spontaneously performing their newly written [[jingle]]. Nelson sang the first two (musical) lines in Danny's voice:
:''N-E-S-T-L-E-S,''
:''Nestlé's makes the very best...''
He finished with Farfel slowly singing the last word &quot;chocolate&quot;, in two syllables. Nelson was so nervous that his hands sweated, and when Farfel was finished, his finger slipped off the control, causing the mouth to audibly snap shut, a mistake no ventriloquist should make. Nelson left the audition thinking he had blown it, but was surprised to learn he was hired; in fact, the executives actually liked the mouth-snapping effect and asked that he keep it. This became his trademark as the commercials ran for ten years.

When advertising Nestlé's Quik, Danny O'Day would say it &quot;makes milk taste...like a ''million''&quot; (dollars), again slowly and pausing for effect.

===Film career===
In 2009 Nelson was featured in the ventriloquist comedy documentary ''I'm No Dummy'',&lt;ref name=&quot;I'm No Dummy&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/] IMDB: I'm No Dummy http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0926091/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Digital Cinema Report&quot;&gt;[http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165] Digital Cinema Report http://digitalcinemareport.com/node/1165&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Bryan W. Simon]].

==Later years==

Jimmy, and his wife Betty have been residents of Cape Coral, Florida since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Jimmy Nelson is moving to Cape Coral http://ufdc.ufl.edu/SW10000983/00001&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared with Danny and Farfel at local schools and was a long time spokesperson for First Federal Savings and Loan of Fort Myers.

Jimmy Nelson was dubbed in 2011 as &quot;The Dean of American Ventriloquists.&quot;

Jimmy collaborated in 2011 with maker of professional ventriloquist figures [[Tim Selberg]] to produce a character that pays homage to his Danny O'Day.

==Family==
Jimmy and Margot's three boys were twins, Larry and Lee, and Jerry. They lived for many years in Forest Hills, NY and later in Jamaica, NY.

In 1956, Jimmy Nelson married Betty Norman, a night club singer who he worked with and had the remainder of his 3 kids with.

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:Goff southeast tents]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:Goff southeast tents]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Goff southeast tents|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Goff southeast tents|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Nthep|NtheP]] ([[User talk:Nthep|talk]]) 17:50, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

== November 2010 ==
[[Image:Information.svg|25px|alt=|link=]] [[Wikipedia:Introduction|Welcome]] to Wikipedia. It might not have been your intention, but you removed a [[Wikipedia:Speedy deletions|speedy deletion]] tag from [[:Goff southeast tents]], a page you have created yourself.  If you do not believe the page should be deleted, you can place a {{[[Template:hangon|hangon]]}} tag on the page, under the existing speedy deletion tag (please do not remove the speedy deletion tag), and make your case on the page's [[Talk:Goff southeast tents|talk page]]. Administrators will look at your reasoning before deciding what to do with the page.

== Sock puppetry ==

Hello, I must inform you, that the general rule is one editor, one account. Do not use multiple accounts to mislead, deceive, or disrupt; to create the illusion of greater support for a position; to stir up controversy; or to circumvent a block. Do not ask your friends to create accounts to support you. The misuse of multiple accounts is considered a serious breach of community trust. It is likely to lead to a block of all affected accounts, a ban of the user behind the accounts, and on-project exposure of all accounts and IPs used across Wikipedia and its sister projects, as well as the (potential) public exposure of any &quot;real-world&quot; activities or personal information deemed relevant to preventing future sock puppetry.--[[User:Yopie|Yopie]] ([[User talk:Yopie|talk]]) 20:07, 24 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Paiján culture''' was an [[archaeological culture]] that developed on the northern coast of [[Peru]] between 8,700 and 5,900  [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay et al, &quot;The first settlers&quot;, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was first described by Peruvian archaeologist [[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] in the 1940s from the Pampa de los Fósiles site.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay, ''The Settlement of the Americas'', p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt; Later research, mainly by French archaeologist Claude Chauchat, identified dozens of open air sites, which include camps, workshops and quarries.&lt;ref&gt;Danièle Lavallée, ''The first South Americans'', pp. 97–98.&lt;/ref&gt; Most findings are concentrated along the valleys of the rivers Jequetepeque, Cupisnique, Chicama and Moche in the northern coast of Peru; more limited evidences of Paiján presence have been found in the central and south coasts of Peru as well as in the highland site of [[Pre-Columbian Ecuador#El Inga|El Inga]] in Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay, ''The Settlement of the Americas'', pp. 145–146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Paiján environment was arid with sparse vegetation and small animals such as rodents, lizards and snails; further resources were provided by the sea which at the time was located 15 kilometers farther than today due to a .lower sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Danièle Lavallée, ''The first South Americans'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; To adapt to this environment, the Paiján developed long needle–like [[projectile point]]s which were mounted on hollow shafts of cane or reed and be used as harpoons to catch fish; they also collected snails, hunted small animals such as [[vizcacha]]s and used grinding stones to process plants.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Moseley, ''The Incas and their ancestors'', pp. 93–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early Paiján sites, dated between 8,600 and 8,000 BCE, indicate large bands that moved seasonally between the coastal plains and the western slopes of the Andes; later sites, dated between 8,000 and 6,500 BCE, evidence smaller groups of decreased mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay et al, &quot;The first settlers&quot;, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt; According to anthropologist [[Tom Dillehay]], a possible explanation for this change is that an amelioration of the climate increased the availability of wild plants and animals; thus, Paiján people required less movement to meet their requirements while still relying on [[hunting-gathering]].&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dillehay, &quot;Profiles in Holocene History&quot;, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thank you for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and the page that you created has been or soon will be deleted. Please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]] for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome page]] if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Sashi Rachakonda|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Sashi Rachakonda|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-test-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:51, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:Sashi Rachakonda]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Sashi Rachakonda|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Sashi Rachakonda|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Kudpung|Kudpung]] ([[User talk:Kudpung|talk]]) 08:36, 17 November 2010 (UTC)

I have removed your speculations about ''Saw VIII'' characters appearing, as well as the section added listed characters that will be in ''Saw VIII'' since there is no sources listed showing that these are indeed characters that will be in the film. The information you added about the characters that might appear is also unsourced (saying how a characters dies in the film before the film is released and giving full details on a character) has been removed as well as it appears to be unreliable. If you add this information again, provide reliable sources, if you don't, the information will be removed and you may be blocked.

'''Welcome!'''

Hello, YouEqualLove, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia! Thank you for [[Special:Contributions/YouEqualLove|your contributions]]. I hope you like the place and decide to stay. Unfortunately, one or more of the pages you created, such as [[You=Love]], may not conform to some of Wikipedia's [[Wikipedia:List of policies|guidelines]], and may soon be deleted. 

There's a page about creating articles you may want to read called '''[[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]'''. If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:
* [[Wikipedia:Starting an article|Starting an article]]
* [[Wikipedia:Your first article|Your first article]]

* [[Wikipedia:How to write a great article|How to write a great article]]

I hope you enjoy editing here and being a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! Please [[Wikipedia:Signatures|sign your name]] on talk pages using four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;); this will automatically produce your name and the date.

==[[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion|Speedy deletion]] nomination of [[:You=Love]]==
[[Image:Ambox warning pn.svg|48px|left|alt=|link=]]
{{Quote box|quote=&lt;p&gt;If this is the first article that you have created, you may want to read [[WP:Your first article|the guide to writing your first article]].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You may want to consider using the [[Wikipedia:Article wizard|Article Wizard]] to help you create articles.&lt;/p&gt;|width=20%|align=right}}
A tag has been placed on [[:You=Love]] requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#A7|section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the article appears to be about web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the [[WP:CSD#Articles|criteria for speedy deletion]], such articles may be deleted at any time. Please [[Wikipedia:Notability|see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:You=Love|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:You=Love|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-notability-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; - [[User:Realkyhick|Realkyhick]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Realkyhick|Talk to me]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:52, 16 November 2010 (UTC)

A tag has been placed on [[:User:YouEqualLove]], requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under [[WP:CSD#G11|section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion]], because the page seems to be unambiguous advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article. Please read [[Wikipedia:Spam|the guidelines on spam]] and [[Wikipedia:FAQ/Business]] for more information. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:User:YouEqualLove|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[User talk:YouEqualLove|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay.

[[:WP:NOBLECAUSE|Wikipedia is not here to publicize your noble idea.]]&lt;div class=&quot;user-block&quot;&gt;[[Image:Stop_x_nuvola.svg|left|35px|alt=|link=]]&lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 105%;&quot;&gt;Your account has been '''blocked indefinitely''' from editing Wikipedia because it appears to be mainly intended or used for publicity and/or promotional purposes. Please read the following carefully.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Why can't I edit Wikipedia?'''&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[[Special:MyContributions|Your account's edits]] and/or username indicate that it is being used on behalf of a company, group, celebrity or other well-known individual, or organization for purposes of promotion and/or publicity. The edits may have violated one or more of our rules on spamming, which include: [[WP:LINKSPAM|adding inappropriate external links]], [[WP:SPAM|posting advertisements]], and [[WP:PROMOTION|using Wikipedia for promotion]]. Wikipedia has many articles on companies, groups, and organizations, but it is considered inappropriate for such groups to use Wikipedia to write about themselves. ''In addition'', usernames like yours are disallowed under our [[WP:ORGNAME|username policy]].

;Am I allowed to make these edits if I change my username?
Probably not.  See [[WP:FAQ/Organization]] for a helpful list of frequently asked questions by people in your position. Also, review the [[WP:COI|conflict of interest guidance]] to see the kinds of limitations you would have to obey if you did want to continue editing about your company, group, or organization. If this does not fit in with your goals, then you will not be allowed to edit again. Consider using [[WP:OUT|one of the many websites]] that allow this instead.

;What can I do now?
You are still welcome to write about something other than your company or organization. If you ''do'' intend to make useful contributions on some other topic, you must convince a [[WP:ADMIN|Wikipedia administrator]] that you mean it. To that end, please do the following:

*Add the text &lt;!-- Copy the text as it appears on your page, not as it appears in this edit area. Do not include the &quot;tlx&quot; argument. --&gt;{{tlx|unblock-spamun|Your proposed new username|Your reason here}} on [[Special:MyTalk|your user talk page]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your proposed new username&quot; with a new username you are willing to use. See [[Special:Listusers]] to search for available usernames. Your new username will need to meet our [[WP:U|username policy]].
*Replace the text &quot;Your reason here&quot; with your reason to be unblocked. In this reason, you must:
:*Convince us that you understand the reason for your block and that you will not repeat the edits for which you were blocked.
:*Describe in general terms the contributions that you intend to make if you are unblocked.

If you believe this block was made in error, please see how to [[WP:AAB|appeal a block]]. &lt;/div&gt;[[Category:Wikipedians who are indefinitely blocked for promotional user names|{{PAGENAME}}]]{{z17}}&lt;!-- Template:Uw-spamublock --&gt;--[[User:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;darkorange&quot;&gt;Orange Mike&lt;/font&gt;]]  &amp;#x007C;  [[User talk:Orangemike|&lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;Talk&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:25, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

  If we shadows have offended,
  Think but this, and all is mended,
  That you have but slumber'd here
  While these visions did appear.
  And this weak and idle theme,
  No more yielding but a dream,
  Gentles, do not reprehend:
  if you pardon, we will mend:

Not quite up to all the rules, but always up to proper behavior.

== Adding images ==

One of the things you'll find is that you cannot link to images on pages outside wikipedia or other parts of wikimedia.  This is to ensure that all images are correctly acknowledged and copyright respected.  If you want to add an image it must first be uploaded to wikipedia or wikicommons. Hope this helps.

'''''The Secret Rapture''''' is a 1988 British play by [[David Hare (playwright)|David Hare]]. Its premiere in the Lyttelton auditorium of the [[Royal National Theatre]] was directed by [[Howard Davies (director)|Howard Davies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationaltheatre.org.uk/8257/past-events/past-productions-19861990.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/20/theater/review-theater-bennett-breaks-ground-in-britain-as-aloof-meets-aloof-in-spy-case.html?pagewanted=3|title=Review/Theater; Bennett Breaks Ground in Britain As Aloof Meets Aloof in Spy Case - New York Times|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; British revivals of the play have included one at the [[Salisbury Playhouse]] in 2001&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2001/jan/29/theatre.artsfeatures1|title=Theatre review:  The Secret Rapture &amp;#124; Stage &amp;#124; The Guardian|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Lyric Theatre, London]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatreguidelondon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatreguidelondon.co.uk/reviews/secretrapture03.htm|title=Review of The Secret Rapture - 2003|publisher=theatreguidelondon.co.uk|accessdate=2014-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hare later adapted it as [[The Secret Rapture (film)|1993 film of the same title]], also directed by Davies.

It is set in 1980s Britain and examines the impact of [[Thatcherism]] on personal relationships within the family of a junior government minister after her father's death. Hare states that its title refers to a nun's feeling of [[Ecstasy (emotion)|ecstasy]] on being received by God at the moment of her death,&lt;ref name=&quot;curtainup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curtainup.com/secretrapture.html|title=The Secret Rapture,

==Synopsis==
Estranged sisters Isobel and Marion are forced to reunite when their father dies and they must decide how to handle Katherine, their young, alcoholic, mentally unstable stepmother who has been left nothing but the rural home in which they were raised. Isobel and her lover Irwin own a small graphic design company that is struggling to stay afloat. Her sister suggests she and her [[born-again Christian]] husband Tom help them expand the business by finding investors and making Katherine a partner responsible for finding new business. Isobel has grave misgivings about the plan, but finally agrees to it when Marion convinces Irwin of its potential success. Before long, the strain of running the expanded business causes a deterioration in Isobel's relationship with Irwin, who is becoming increasingly dependent upon her, while at the same time Katherine's tenuous hold on sanity begins to unravel.

==Plot==

===Act 1===

====Scene 1====
Isobel is sitting with the body of her father Robert, who has just died. Her elder sister Marion arrives to claim a ring she had given him and the two sisters begin to argue. Marion's husband Tom arrives and Marion leaves, angry with Isobel, then Tom and Isobel talk before leaving.

====Scene 2====
Isobel and her father's second wife, the alcoholic Katherine, sit in the garden of Robert's house just after his funeral. Marion and Tom arrive and an argument begins when Katherine suddenly introduces her idea that she would like to join Isobel's small design firm. Katherine storms out and finds a hidden bottle of drink before returning, whereupon the previously doubtful Isobel agrees that Katherine can join the firm.

====Scene 3====
In the office of Isobel's firm she and her lover Irwin attempt to enjoy a rare evening without Katherine, until Katherine arrives to tell them how she has taken Isobel's friend Max out to dinner. Katherine criticises Irwin's design work before leaving and Irwin tries to convince Isobel to get rid of her. Katherine returns and, when Isobel proves unable or unwilling to eject Katherine, Irwin intervenes and asks Katherine to leave in the morning. Katherine leaves temporarily and Isobel refuses to agree to her ejection from the firm.

====Scene 4====
Back at Robert's house, Marion and Tom try to convince Isobel to let them invest in her firm to help it expand, with Irwin betraying Isobel by supporting them rather than her.

===Act 2===

====Scene 1====
Marion's secretary Rhonda comes round to Isobel's firm's new offices for a shower, and she and Irwin flirt over a bottle of champagne until Isobel arrives back unexpectedly. Rhonda leaves for the shower and Isobel reveals that Katherine has stabbed one of the firm's clients and so has had to be put into a rehab clinic. Isobel and Irwin argue and Rhonda returns to the office before leaving to go to the cinema. Isobel surprises her and Irwin by suggesting that they come too and the three leave together.

====Scene 2====
The expansion of Isobel's firm having failed, Marion and Tom wait in Tom's office, to which Irwin comes for a business meeting. He tells them how Isobel left the cinema halfway through the film and took a spur-of-the-moment holiday to Lanzarote, before returning to care for Katherine. He also admits how he is still in love with Isobel despite the friction that now exists between them and Marion criticises her sister's handling of the situation. Isobel arrives and refuses to come into the office until Irwin leaves. Irwin leaves, Isobel enters and she and Marion argue until Isobel finally leaves. A born-again evangelical Christian, Tom then criticises Marion and leaves to pray for Isobel and Irwin.

====Scene 3====
In the lounge of Katherine's flat, Isobel attempts to make her dinner and the two talk before preparing a sofa-bed for Isobel to stay the night. Katherine leaves for her bedroom and Isobel settles down to read, before Irwin arrives, thanks to Katherine who has secretly disobeyed Isobel and unbolted to door so he can get in. Irwin has brought a gun with him and begs Isobel to sleep with him - she refuses and the pair argue. Katherine returns and Isobel fails to convince her to go out to get the police to eject Irwin. Isobel then prepares to go out and Irwin shoots her just as she leaves.

====Scene 4====
Back at Robert's house, Marion, Tom and Katherine reinstate its furniture and prepare for Isobel's funeral. Katherine leaves and Tom and Marion discuss her emotional difficulties. They then kiss and Tom leaves, before Marion ends the play with an emotional appeal to her dead sister.

'''''Acoustic Live!''''' is the first [[extended play]] (EP) by American singer [[Adam Lambert]], released on December 6, 2010. The EP features acoustic versions of four songs from Lambert's debut album, [[For Your Entertainment (album)|''For Your Entertainment'']], as well as his show-stopping &quot;Mad World&quot; rendition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adamofficial.com/us/news/acoustic-live-out-today |title=Acoustic Live! Out Today &amp;#124; The Official Adam Lambert Site |publisher=Adamofficial.com |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical reception==
The album has since received mostly positive reviews. Jim Farber of ''NY Daily News'' remarks that Lambert is &quot;downright operatic in 'Soaked' and as wild as Freddie Mercury on 'Music Again.' All the stripped background does is give Lambert more room to trill and soar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2010/11/30/2010-11-30_justin_biebers_my_worlds_acoustic_and_adam_lamberts_acoustic_live_reviews.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Elliptical vs. treadmill: Which will give you the better workout? | first=Jim | last=Farber | date=November 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dan Savoie of ''Rockstar Weekly'' gave the album 5 out 5 stars, saying that this acoustic EP better displays &quot;the voice that most fell in love with each week during AI&quot; and that it &quot;is the best representation of Lambert’s voice to date and the CD cover resembles some of the greatest punk rock albums of all time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savoie |first=Dan |url=http://www.rockstarweekly.com/cd-review-adam-lambert-acoustic-live.html |title=CD Review: Adam Lambert - Acoustic Live! |publisher=RockStar Weekly |date= |accessdate=October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyndsey Parker of ''Reality Rocks'' also praises Lambert, saying that the entire EP &quot;thrillingly places Adam's remarkable vocals front-and-center.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/realityrocks/409301/the-acoustic-live-ep-adam-lamberts-new-unplug-in-baby/ |title=The 'Acoustic Live!'

The tale of wanting to escape from a meaningless existence sounds even more urgent as Lambert attacks his acoustic guitar and gives full-throat to that dramatic tenor voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/reviews/2010-12-06-playlist07_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Jerry | last=Shriver | title=Playlist: Adam Lambert's 'Mad World,' plus 10 more | date=December 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hello, Kpblows, and [[Wikipedia:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] to Wikipedia!  I hope you like the place and decide to stay.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the '''[[Wikipedia:New contributors' help page|New contributors' help page]]''', where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! Or, you can just type '''{{t|helpme}}''' on this page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

Please refrain from introducing inappropriate pages, such as [[:James Codega]], to Wikipedia. Doing so is not in accordance with our [[Wikipedia:List of policies|policies]]. If you would like to experiment, please use the [[Wikipedia:Sandbox|sandbox]]. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:James Codega|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:James Codega|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.  &lt;!-- Template:Db-vandalism-notice --&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Morbidthoughts|Morbidthoughts]] ([[User talk:Morbidthoughts|talk]]) 17:55, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding {{tlc|hang on}} to '''the top of [[:Kendor Music, Inc.|the page that has been nominated for deletion]]''' (just below the existing speedy deletion, or &quot;db&quot;, tag; if no such tag exists, then the page is no longer a speedy delete candidate and adding a hang-on tag is unnecessary), coupled with adding a note on '''[[Talk:Kendor Music, Inc.|the talk page]]''' explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for ''speedy'' deletion, if the page meets the criterion, it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the page that would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines. If the page is deleted, you can contact [[:Category:Wikipedia administrators who will provide copies of deleted articles|one of these administrators]] to request that the administrator [[Wikipedia:Userfication#Userfication_of_deleted_content|userfy]] the page or email a copy to you. &lt;!-- Template:Db-spam-notice --&gt; &lt;!-- Template:Db-csd-notice-custom --&gt; [[User:Ironholds|Ironholds]] ([[User talk:Ironholds|talk]]) 17:57, 16 November 2010 (UTC)</text>

'''''Triteleia grandiflora''''' is a species of [[flowering plant]] known by the common name '''Largeflower Tripletlily '''or''' Wild Hyacinth '''. It is native to western North America from [[British Columbia]] to extreme northern [[California]], eastward into [[Idaho]], [[Montana]] and northern [[Utah]], with [[disjunct distribution|disjunct]] populations occurring in [[Wyoming]] and [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=fs&gt;Ladyman, J. (2007). [http://www.fs.fed.us/r2/projects/scp/assessments/triteleiagrandiflora.pdf ''Triteleia grandiflora'': A technical conservation assessment.] US Forest Service.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bonap.net/MapGallery/County/Triteleia%20grandiflora.png Biota of North America Program, 2013 county distribution map]&lt;/ref&gt; Its habitat includes [[grassland]], [[sagebrush]], woodlands, and forests. It is a perennial herb growing from a [[corm]]. It produces two or three basal leaves up to 70 centimeters long by one wide. The [[inflorescence]] arises on a smooth, erect stem up to 75 centimeters tall and bears an [[umbel]]-like cluster of many flowers. Each flower is a funnel-shaped bloom borne on a [[Pedicel (botany)|pedicel]] up to 4 or 5 centimeters long. The flower may be up to 3.5 centimeters long including the tubular throat and six [[tepal]]s each just over a centimeter long. The inner set of three tepals are somewhat ruffled and broader than the outer tepals. The flower corolla may be deep blue to almost white with a darker blue mid-vein. There are six [[stamen]]s with purple or yellow anthers.

The corm provides food for various wild [[rodent]]s and [[livestock]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[settler]]s found them edible as well.&lt;ref name=fs/&gt;
